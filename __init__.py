"""ComfyUI entry point for comfyui-lora-library.

This is the only file in the pack that touches ComfyUI's own modules
(``server``, ``folder_paths``). It builds the real
:class:`~lora_library.context.LibraryContext`, registers the HTTP routes and
the nodes, and exposes the standard ``NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS`` /
``WEB_DIRECTORY`` attributes ComfyUI's loader looks for. Everything under
``lora_library/`` stays importable (and tested) without ComfyUI — see
``lora_library/context.py``.

Feature modules are imported DEFENSIVELY: a broken or not-yet-present
feature logs loudly and is skipped, and the rest of the pack still loads —
one bad module must never take the whole pack (or a user's queue) down.
