"""``EPSFrameSaver`` (FORMAT.md §6.7, display: "EPS Frame Saver") — pick a
video by path, scrub to a frame in-node, output that exact frame + its size.

Owner decisions locked (FORMAT.md §6.7):

- **PATH source, never a copy.** ``video_path`` is chosen via a server-side
  Browse dialog (``web/eps_image/frame_saver.js``, reusing the pack's
  ``/lora_library/fs/list`` fs-browse standard with a video ext allowlist) —
  unlike core's own ``LoadImage``/VHS's ``VHS_LoadVideo``, the file is never
  copied into ComfyUI's ``input/`` directory.
- **Single-frame output, not a list.** ``OUTPUT_IS_LIST`` is deliberately
  ABSENT — this matches the sibling pack's ``PremiereShotFrame`` (FORMAT.md
  §6.7's own citation). Multi-frame extraction is an explicitly deferred
  future sibling node.
- **"Close-enough preview, EXACT frame on output."** The frontend player only
  ever drives an *approximate* ``<video>``-element preview off the probed
  fps/frame_count; THIS node's :meth:`EPSFrameSaver.run` always re-decodes
  the exact requested frame straight from the source file at execution
  time, completely independent of whatever the preview happened to show.

No torch/av/ComfyUI import anywhere at module scope — :meth:`run` only
reaches into :mod:`eps_image.frame_saver_video` (which itself lazily imports
``av``/``torch``, see that module's docstring), so this file stays importable
in a plain test environment with neither installed — same convention as
every other node in this pack (``eps_image/nodes_resolution.py``,
``eps_image/nodes_image_grid.py``).

#: A generous static ceiling for the `frame` widget's declared INT range.
#: `INPUT_TYPES` is evaluated once at class-registration time, long before
#: any particular `video_path` is known, so it can never reflect a REAL
#: video's actual frame count -- that's the frontend's job, per-node-
#: instance, once `GET /eps_frame_saver/probe` returns one (FORMAT.md §6.7).
#: This is just wide enough to never clip a legitimate request; `extract_frame`
#: clamps a too-large index down to the video's last frame regardless (it
#: never errors purely for running past the end -- see that function's
#: docstring), so this ceiling is a UI nicety, not a correctness boundary.
