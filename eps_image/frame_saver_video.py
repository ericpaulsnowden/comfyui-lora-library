"""PyAV probe + frame-extraction helpers for ``EPSFrameSaver`` (FORMAT.md §6.7).

Mirrors two of Eric's own MIT recipes, verified against this pack's sibling
package:

- **Frame extraction** — ``comfyui-premiere-bridge/cprb/frame_extract.py``'s
  ``extract_frame``: seek the container toward the target (a container only
  ever seeks to a keyframe at/before the target, never an arbitrary frame
  exactly), then decode FORWARD from there, keeping the LAST frame decoded
  until one's ``pts`` reaches the target — closest-available, never an error
  purely because the target ran past the end of the stream. Ported here
  almost verbatim; the only real change is the caller's unit: cprb's
  ``extract_frame`` takes ``in_seconds`` directly (a Premiere sequence-time
  value), this node's is a ``frame_index`` (FORMAT.md §6.7: "frame_index/fps
  -> target_seconds" is the one conversion layered on top).
- **Frame-count cascade** — ComfyUI core's ``VideoFromFile.get_frame_count``
  (``comfy_api/latest/_input_impl/video_types.py``): prefer ``stream.frames``
  when it's a positive, directly-reported count; else estimate
  ``round(duration_seconds * fps)`` from whatever duration metadata the
  stream/container exposes; else decode every frame and count them as a last
  resort. :func:`probe`'s :func:`_frame_count_cascade` is the same 3-tier
  order, trimmed to this node's simpler "probe the whole file" case (no
  ``start_time``/``duration`` trim window — that's core's own trimmed-video
  feature, not part of this node).

Both ``av`` and ``torch`` are HARD ComfyUI dependencies (installed as part of
ComfyUI itself, same as every other node in this pack that touches either),
but every import of either is LAZY, inside the function that actually needs
it, never at module scope — this file, and therefore ``nodes_frame_saver.py``
(which imports it at ITS module scope), stays importable under a bare
``pytest`` run on a machine with neither installed. Same convention as
``eps_image/nodes_resolution.py`` and ``comfyui-premiere-bridge/cprb/
probe.py``/``cprb/frame_extract.py``.

Every raised error is a plain :class:`ValueError` naming the offending
*path* — never a raw PyAV/ffmpeg traceback (FORMAT.md §6.7) — so the HTTP
routes (``routes_frame_saver.py``) can turn it straight into a clean 400,
and the node (``nodes_frame_saver.py``) can let it surface as ComfyUI's
normal node-error UI.

    seeks the container toward the target (landing on the nearest keyframe
    at/before it — containers don't seek to arbitrary frames), then decodes
    FORWARD, keeping the LAST frame seen until one's ``pts`` reaches the
    target or the stream runs out. A *frame_index* past the last real frame
    therefore never errors — decoding simply reaches the end of the stream
    and the last frame decoded (the closest available) is returned; this is
    the "clamps out-of-range" behavior on the high side. A negative
    *frame_index* clamps to ``0`` on the low side (there is no "before the
    first frame").
