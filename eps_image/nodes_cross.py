"""``EPSCrossProduct`` (FORMAT.md §6.9, display: "EPS Cross Product") —
pair EVERY image with EVERY text.

Why this node exists (owner report, 2026-07-23): wiring TWO fanned lists
into the same downstream path does NOT multiply them. ComfyUI's core list
execution ZIPS lists index-by-index and repeats the SHORTER list's last
element (``execution.py``'s ``slice_dict``: ``v[i if len(v) > i else -1]``)
— so a 2-image EPS Image Grid paired with 4 selected EPS Prompt Notebook
entries runs downstream 4 times as (img1, p1), (img2, p2), (img2, p3),
(img2, p4): the owner's observed "1 layer from the first image and 3 from
the second", where 2 x 4 = 8 was wanted. Core has no cross-product
mechanism; this node is it: N images x M texts -> N*M pairs, image-major
(img1 with every text in order, then img2 with every text, ...), each pair
riding out through two ``OUTPUT_IS_LIST`` outputs that stay index-aligned
by construction.

``INPUT_IS_LIST = True`` for the same reason as ``EPSSwitcher`` (see
``nodes_switcher.py``'s module docstring): without it, core would map THIS
node once per element of the longer input — zipping the very lists we're
here to multiply — instead of handing both lists over whole.

No torch/ComfyUI import anywhere at module scope: elements are treated as
opaque values (an image element that is a ``[B,H,W,C]`` batch stays ONE
element, exactly like the switcher's flatten semantics), so this module
stays importable in a bare test environment.
