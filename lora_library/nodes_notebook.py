    """Reads one or more FORMAT.md §3 notebook entries' text + name.

    Re-reads and re-parses the file on every execution (§6: "the file is
    the truth; the UI is a view") — the two-pane editor (§7.2) is a DOM
    widget that never serializes into the workflow; only the ``file``/
    ``entry`` STRING widgets do, so this is the only place that ever turns
    those two strings into text. A missing file, an empty selection, or ANY
    missing selected entry is a loud node error naming the file and every
    missing entry (queue-time failure, per §6.1) rather than a partial or
    empty-string passthrough — unlike ``LoraLibraryApplySet``'s "missing
    set ⇒ silent passthrough" (FORMAT.md §4/§6.2), a notebook entry's text
    IS this node's entire output.

    Multi-select (§6.1): ``entry`` is one name per line, in selection
    order. Outputs are ``("text","name")``, both declared
    ``OUTPUT_IS_LIST``, with element *i* = the i-th selected entry's §3.3
    text and heading name — a single-line ``entry`` is the degenerate
    one-element case, so every pre-multiselect workflow is unchanged.

    Confirmed against a running ComfyUI's ``execution.py``
    (``_async_map_node_over_list`` / ``merge_result_data``): this node sets
    no ``INPUT_IS_LIST`` and its widgets are scalar, so ``read_entry``
    itself still runs exactly ONCE per queued execution — all the fan-out
    described below is a downstream effect, not a re-invocation of this
    node. ``merge_result_data`` sees ``OUTPUT_IS_LIST[i] is True`` and
    ``extend()``s our one result's per-output lists straight into the
    node's output-slot lists (length = selection count, no wrapping). Any
    ordinary (non-``INPUT_IS_LIST``) downstream node then computes its own
    ``max_len_input`` from those list lengths and calls itself once per
    index via ``slice_dict`` (which repeats the *last* element for any
    shorter co-input rather than erroring, so ``text``/``name`` — always
    equal length here — stay correctly paired at every index) — i.e. one
    queued run fans out into one execution per selected entry downstream,
    each with its matching (text, name) pair. That is exactly FORMAT.md
    §6.1's "one queued run = one generation per selected prompt". A
    single-line ``entry`` yields length-1 lists, so a plain single-
    selection wiring still executes exactly once downstream too.
