# FORMAT.md — the binding contract for EPSNodes

Naming (2026-07-18 rebrand, refined same day): the PACK is **EPSNodes**
everywhere a user sees it (node-browser category, Settings section, About
badge); the REPO/install folder is **`comfyui-epsnodes`**, matching the
sibling plugins' `comfyui-*` convention (owner decision). The python
module `lora_library/`, the `/lora_library/*` route prefix, and the
`LoraLibrary*` node class ids are the pack's first FEATURE FAMILY and stay
frozen (§8) — future non-lora features arrive as sibling modules under the
same EPSNodes banner, without repo churn. `LoraLibraryNotebook`'s display
name is **"Prompt Notebook"** (it stores prompts; the original name was a
misnomer).

This document is BINDING, in the comfyui-photoshop-bridge PROTOCOL.md sense:
the backend (`lora_library/`), the frontend (`web/`), and the on-disk file
formats must all match what is written here. Any interface change amends this
file FIRST, in the same commit as the code. Section numbers are stable —
cite them in code comments as `FORMAT.md §N`.

## §1 The library directory

One directory holds everything a user shares between machines:

```
<library_dir>/
  loras.md          # default notebook file (§3) — users may add more .md files
  sets/             # one JSON file per saved LoRA set (§4)
    <slug>.json
```

- `library_dir` is persisted server-side in `<comfyui user dir>/lora_library/
  config.json` as `{"library_dir": "<absolute path>"}`. When unset, the
  default is `<comfyui user dir>/lora_library/library/`.
- The whole point of the setting is that it may point ANYWHERE the server
  process can read/write — a NAS share (`\\nas\share\comfy-library`, a mounted
  volume, a Dropbox folder). Multi-machine sharing = both machines' ComfyUIs
  pointing at the same directory. This is the design center (owner
  requirement), not an edge case.
- The notebook node's `file` value resolves per
  `LibraryContext.resolve_notebook_file`: relative → under `library_dir`;
  absolute (incl. UNC) → used as-is. Set files are ALWAYS under
  `<library_dir>/sets/` — sets are library-wide, not per-workflow.
- Writes are atomic (same-directory temp file + `os.replace`) and preserve
  the target file's dominant line-ending style (§3.6). Never call
  `os.path.relpath` against ComfyUI dirs (cross-drive crash on Windows).

## §2 Security posture

ComfyUI custom routes have no auth layer, so exposure follows the server's
own bind address:

- **Loopback requests** (`request.remote` is 127.0.0.1/::1): full capability —
  read/write any path the process user can touch, per §1.
- **Non-loopback requests** (the server is `--listen`-ing and the caller is
  another machine): mutating routes (§5 POST) and arbitrary-path reads REFUSE
  paths outside `library_dir` with `403 {"error": ...}` naming this section.
  Everything inside `library_dir` still works — a remote browser tab driving
  a shared library is legitimate.
- Notebook writes additionally require the resolved path to end in `.md`
  (any request origin). Set slugs must match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-_]*$` and
  resolve strictly inside `sets/` (no traversal).
- `POST /lora_library/config` is loopback-only: `library_dir` IS the
  boundary the two rules above enforce for remote callers, so only the
  local machine may move it.

## §3 Notebook markdown grammar

A notebook file is plain Markdown, hand-editable in any editor. The unit of
retrieval is the **entry**.

### §3.1 Structure

```
(optional preamble — anything before the first heading, preserved verbatim)

# Category Name          ← optional H1 = category (groups entries)

## Entry Name            ← H2 = one entry
entry body …             ← everything until the next H1/H2 heading

## Another Entry
…
```

- `## ` (H2) starts an entry; the heading text (trimmed) is the entry name.
- `# ` (H1) starts a category; entries that follow belong to it until the
  next H1. Entries before any H1 have category `""`.
- **Category description** (owner ask 2026-07-19): the prose between a
  `# Category` heading and its first `## entry` (or the next heading) is
  that category's DESCRIPTION — plain text, preserved verbatim on
  round-trip, empty when absent. It is presentation/reference prose only:
  it is never an entry, never appears in the node's outputs.
- `###` and deeper headings belong to the entry body (they do NOT split).
- Fenced code blocks (``` … ```) are respected: heading-looking lines inside
  a fence are body text, not boundaries.

### §3.2 Names

- Entry names are unique per file, compared case-sensitively after trimming.
  A file with duplicates still parses: the FIRST occurrence is addressable;
  every duplicate is reported in the route's `problems` array (§5) so the UI
  can warn. Names cannot contain newlines; empty H2 headings are reported as
  problems and skipped.

### §3.3 Entry text (what the node outputs)

- The entry's text is its body verbatim, minus leading/trailing blank lines,
  joined with `\n`. Internal blank lines are preserved. This exact string is
  the node's STRING output — no substitution, no templating (v1).

### §3.4 Write operations (roundtrip safety)

Writers re-emit the file from the parse, with these guarantees:

- Preamble, category headings, category order, entry order, and every
  untouched entry's body are preserved byte-for-byte (modulo §3.6 line
  endings and a single guaranteed trailing newline).
- **Update** replaces one entry's body in place (and/or renames its heading).
- **Create** appends the entry: to the end of the named category when
  `category` is provided (creating the category heading at end-of-file if
  new), else to the end of the file.
- **Delete** removes the entry's heading + body. Deleting a category's last
  entry leaves the (now empty) category heading in place — categories are
  the user's prose, not derived state.
- A body line that itself starts with `# ` or `## ` (outside a fence) cannot
  be represented; saves containing one are refused with 400 and a message
  telling the user to use `###`, indentation, or a code fence.
- **Create category** appends a new `# Name` heading at end-of-file (name
  must be unique among categories, non-empty after trimming, no newlines);
  **Set category description** replaces the §3.1 description block under
  an existing heading (same un-representable-line rule as entry bodies:
  a description line starting with `# `/`## ` outside a fence is refused).
- **Move** relocates one entry (drag-reorder's primitive): to just before a
  named sibling entry, or to the END of a named category (creating that
  category heading at end-of-file when new), or to the end of the file
  (`category: ""` targets the uncategorized head region only when one
  exists, else the file start). Category membership FOLLOWS position — the
  file is the truth, so dragging an entry under another category heading IS
  the category change. The moved entry's body travels byte-identically.
- **Create after** (owner ask 2026-07-19 "New makes an entry right below
  the selected one"): create supports an optional `after` = an existing
  entry name; the new entry is inserted immediately BELOW it (same
  category), rather than at end-of-file/category. `after` naming an unknown
  entry, or omitted, falls back to the existing append behavior. The new
  entry's name must still be unique (§3.2).
- **Move category** (owner ask 2026-07-19 "drag category and everything in
  it"): relocate a whole category block — its `# heading`, its §3.1
  description, and ALL its entries as one unit — to just before another
  named category, or to end-of-file. Every moved entry's body and the
  description travel byte-identically; the relative order inside the block
  is preserved. The uncategorized head region (`""`) is not a movable
  category.

### §3.5 Concurrency (the two-machine case)

Save/delete requests carry `base_mtime` (the file mtime the client last
loaded, as a float). If the file's current mtime differs by more than 1e-6,
the server refuses with `409 {"error", "mtime"}` and writes nothing; the UI
offers reload-then-reapply. Omitting `base_mtime` skips the check (first
save to a brand-new file).

### §3.6 Line endings

On write, the file's dominant existing line ending (CRLF vs LF; LF for new
files) is preserved across the whole file — a library shared between the
Windows PC and the Mac must not flip-flop diffs.

## §4 Set files

One JSON file per set: `<library_dir>/sets/<slug>.json`, UTF-8, format:

```json
{
  "format": 1,
  "name": "Cinematic portrait",
  "loras": [
    {"file": "subdir/detailer.safetensors", "on": true,  "strength": 0.8, "strength_clip": null},
    {"file": "film_grain.safetensors",      "on": false, "strength": 1.0, "strength_clip": 0.5}
  ],
  "trigger_words": "cinematic, film grain",
  "notes": ""
}
```

- `format`: integer, currently `1`. Readers reject greater values with a
  clear "update the pack" error and tolerate missing optional fields.
- `loras[]` order **is** application order (reordering is a first-class
  feature). `file` holds the lora exactly as ComfyUI lists it
  (`folder_paths.get_filename_list("loras")`) — NOTE that ComfyUI uses the
  OS's native separator there, so a set written on Windows carries `\` and
  one written on macOS carries `/`. Resolution at apply time is therefore
  SEPARATOR-INSENSITIVE and returns the INSTALLED spelling for this
  machine: exact match after normalizing both sides' separators to `/`
  first, then unique basename match (rgthree-style leniency for
  cross-machine subfolder differences; basename = last segment across
  either separator); a lora that still doesn't resolve — including an
  AMBIGUOUS basename — is SKIPPED WITH A LOGGED WARNING — a missing file
  must not fail the whole run.
- `on: false` rows are kept (they round-trip through the UI) but not applied.
- `strength_clip: null` means "use `strength` for both model and clip"
  (parity with rgthree's single-strength mode).
- `slug` = filename stem; derived from `name` when saving (lowercase; spaces
  → `-`; strip everything outside `[a-z0-9-_]`; collision → `-2`, `-3`, …).
  `name` is the display name and may be any string.

## §5 HTTP routes

All under `/lora_library/`, JSON in/out; errors are `{"error": "<human
message>"}` with a 4xx status. `mtime` values are float POSIX seconds.

| Route | → |
|---|---|
| `GET /lora_library/version` | `{"version": "X.Y.Z"}` |
| `GET /lora_library/config` | `{"library_dir", "default_library_dir", "configured": bool, "is_local": bool}` — `is_local` = §2 loopback verdict for THIS request, so a browser can tell whether it sits on the server machine (drives §7.2's remote read-only gating) |
| `GET /lora_library/fs/list?dir=` | **loopback-only** (403 remote): server-filesystem browser for the §7.2 picker. Empty/missing `dir` ⇒ `library_dir`. `dir="ROOTS"` (sentinel) ⇒ the top level: on Windows every existing drive (`C:\`, `D:\`, `U:\`, …) as `dirs` + `parent: null`; on POSIX the filesystem root `/`. → `{"dir": <abs or "ROOTS">, "parent": <abs, "ROOTS", or null>, "dirs": [names], "files": [names]}` — `files` limited to `.md`; entries sorted case-insensitively; a directory at a drive root reports `parent: "ROOTS"` so the picker can climb to the drive list (the 2026-07-19 "stuck at top of C:\, can't reach another drive/NAS" fix); a UNC path (`\\server\share\…`) passed as `dir` lists normally; unreadable/nonexistent dir ⇒ 400 |
| `POST /lora_library/notebook/open_folder` `{"file"}` | **loopback-only** (403 remote): reveals the resolved notebook file's folder in the OS file manager ON THE SERVER MACHINE (Explorer/Finder). Missing folder ⇒ 404; `{"ok": true}` |
| `POST /lora_library/config` `{"library_dir"}` | validates (absolute, creatable, writable), persists; `{"ok", "library_dir"}` |
| `GET /lora_library/loras` | `{"loras": [".."]}` — installed loras for pickers |
| `GET /lora_library/notebook?file=` | `{"file": <resolved abs>, "exists": bool, "mtime", "entries": [{"name","category"}], "categories": [names in file order — includes EMPTY categories, which `entries` alone can't reveal], "problems": [".."]}` (missing file ⇒ `exists:false`, empty lists — NOT an error) |
| `GET /lora_library/notebook/category?file=&name=` | `{"name","description","mtime"}`; 404 if no such category |
| `POST /lora_library/notebook/category` `{"file","name","description"?,"after"?,"rename_to"?,"base_mtime"?}` | §3.4 create-or-describe: unknown `name` ⇒ CREATE the category (default end-of-file; `after` = insert the new `# heading` right after that entry/category — used by New-below when the active item is a category) with the given description; known `name` ⇒ replace its description and, when `rename_to` is present, rename the heading (unique among categories). §3.5 ⇒ 409; un-representable description lines ⇒ 400. → `{"ok","mtime","entries","categories"}` |
| `GET /lora_library/notebook/entry?file=&name=` | `{"name","category","text","mtime"}`; 404 if absent |
| `POST /lora_library/notebook/entry` `{"file","name","text","category"?,"after"?,"rename_to"?,"base_mtime"?}` | create-or-update per §3.4/§3.5; `after` = insert a NEW entry directly below that entry (§3.4 Create after); `{"ok","mtime","entries"}` (fresh list) |
| `POST /lora_library/notebook/move_category` `{"file","name","before"?,"base_mtime"?}` | §3.4 Move category: relocate the whole block before the named category, or to end-of-file when `before` omitted; unknown `name`/`before` ⇒ 404; §3.5 ⇒ 409; `{"ok","mtime","entries","categories"}` |
| `POST /lora_library/notebook/delete` `{"file","name","base_mtime"?}` | `{"ok","mtime","entries"}` |
| `POST /lora_library/notebook/move` `{"file","name","before"?,"category"?,"base_mtime"?}` | §3.4 Move: exactly one of `before` (entry name to insert before) or `category` (append to that category's end; `""` = uncategorized/file-end rule) — both/neither ⇒ 400; unknown `name`/`before` ⇒ 404; §3.5 conflicts ⇒ 409; `{"ok","mtime","entries"}` |
| `GET /lora_library/sets` | `{"sets": [{"slug","name","count"}]}` sorted by name |
| `GET /lora_library/set?slug=` | the full §4 JSON + `"slug"` |
| `POST /lora_library/set` `{"slug"?, "set": {…}}` | save (slug derived from `set.name` when absent); `{"ok","slug","sets"}` |
| `POST /lora_library/set/delete` `{"slug"}` | `{"ok","sets"}` |

Route paths are FROZEN once shipped (§8).

## §6 Nodes

Class ids are FROZEN once shipped. Both nodes re-read their files at every
execution — **the file is the truth; the UI is a view.**

### §6.1 `LoraLibraryNotebook` (display: "Prompt Notebook")

- Widgets: `file` (STRING, default `"loras.md"`), `entry` (STRING — the
  SELECTION; the DOM widget UI sets it, but it stays a plain serialized
  STRING so workflows and the API can drive it without our JS). Multi-
  select: `entry` holds one entry name per LINE (newline-separated, order =
  selection order); a single name is the degenerate one-line case, so every
  pre-multiselect workflow keeps working unchanged.
- The two-pane editor (§7.2) is a DOM widget that does NOT serialize into
  the workflow — only `file` + `entry` persist (owner requirement: the
  workflow stores the pointer, never the text).
- Outputs: `text` (STRING) + `name` (STRING), both declared
  `OUTPUT_IS_LIST` — one element per selected entry, in selection order.
  ComfyUI's list execution then runs every downstream consumer once per
  element: selecting three prompts queues one run that generates with each
  prompt separately (the owner's fan-out ask), and a single selection
  behaves exactly like a plain STRING for typical wiring. `name` is the
  entry's heading text (§3.2) — usable for filename prefixes, captions, or
  routing.
- Execution: resolve → parse → return the entries' texts+names. Missing
  file, an empty selection, or ANY missing selected entry ⇒ node error
  naming the file/entry (a failed lookup must be loud at queue time, §3.5
  notwithstanding).
- `IS_CHANGED` → `(resolved_path, mtime, size, entry)` tuple-ish string so an
  on-disk edit from the *other* machine re-executes; `VALIDATE_INPUTS`
  returns True (entry names are dynamic).

### §6.2 `LoraLibraryApplySet` (display: "Apply LoRA Set")

- Optional inputs: `model` (MODEL), `clip` (CLIP).
- Widgets: `set` (COMBO of set names by slug + `"None"`), `strength_scale`
  (FLOAT 0.0–2.0, default 1.0, step 0.05 — master multiplier on every
  applied strength).
- Outputs: `MODEL`, `CLIP`, `LORA_STACK`, `STRING` (`trigger_words`),
  `STRING` (`loras_text`).
- `loras_text` is the normalized summary of what was applied (owner format,
  2026-07-18c — filename/caption-friendly, no `<>`/`:` punctuation): the
  enabled, resolved rows in order as `stem_strength` tokens —
  `MYLORA_HIGH_1`, `detailer_0.8` (dual strengths append both:
  `detailer_0.8_0.4`) — `stem` = basename without extension, strengths
  post-`strength_scale` formatted `%g`, tokens space-joined; `""` when
  nothing applied.
- Behavior: loads the §4 file; applies enabled rows IN ORDER via the same
  core machinery ComfyUI's own LoraLoader uses, when `model`/`clip` are
  wired; always emits `LORA_STACK` = `[(file, strength_model,
  strength_clip), …]` for enabled rows (efficiency-nodes-compatible) and
  `trigger_words`. With no model/clip wired the node is a pure
  stack/trigger source. `"None"` (or a missing/unresolvable set) with
  model/clip wired ⇒ passthrough + empty stack; missing SET file logs a
  warning, missing individual loras follow §4 skip rules.
- `IS_CHANGED` → set file mtime/size + widget values; `VALIDATE_INPUTS`
  True (set list is dynamic).
- **Sync target of the controller's Push State (§6.3).** Apply LoRA Set
  needs no structural change for this: the controller's Push State button
  sets each Apply LoRA Set node's `set` widget to a chosen state and
  triggers a re-read. So one controller can keep any number of Apply LoRA
  Set nodes on the same state at once — the owner's "multiple Apply LoRA
  Set nodes all controlled by one controller, kept in sync" use case.

### §6.3 `Lora Loader State Controller` (frontend-only virtual node)

Naming (owner 2026-07-18c, refined 2026-07-19): the node's DISPLAY name is
**"Lora Loader State Controller"** (was "Power Lora Loader State
Controller" — "Power" dropped) and every user-facing word in its UI says
**state**, not set — widget label `state`, buttons `New State` (capture
current rows as a new state), `Save State` (overwrite the selected state
with current rows), `Delete State` (two-click confirm), and `Push State`
(broadcast — below). The class id `LoraLibrarySetController` stays frozen
(§8), and states ARE §4 set files — same storage, same routes, same files
the Apply LoRA Set node reads; only the controller's vocabulary changes.

**Push State** (owner ask 2026-07-19): sets EVERY `LoraLibraryApplySet`
node in the graph to the controller's currently-selected state (writing
each one's `set` widget through its real setter + firing its callback), so
all of them switch together. This is the sync mechanism for the "one
controller drives several Apply LoRA Set nodes" workflow. It also
double-serves as an explicit re-apply, which matters because re-selecting
the already-selected value in a combo does not fire its callback (see the
strength-persistence fix below).

**Strength persistence — 2026-07-19 bug fixes (owner: "Save State doesn't
work; the loader isn't remembering strengths; re-picking reverts").** Two
distinct causes, both fixed here:
1. Re-selecting the SAME state in the `state` combo is a no-op on this
   litegraph fork (the callback only fires when the value CHANGES), so
   after Save State a re-pick never re-applied and looked like a revert.
   Fix: apply must be invokable independently of a combo-value change —
   `Save State` re-applies immediately after saving, and any state
   selection (even to the current value) forces an apply. Verify the
   fork's actual same-value callback behavior live and route around it.
2. Capture must read the LIVE dragged strength. rgthree stores it at
   `widget.value.strength` and mutates in place on step/drag
   (power_lora_loader.js `stepStrength`: `this.value[prop] = …`), so a
   live read is correct — VERIFY on the rig with a REAL strength drag
   (not a programmatic value swap) against a real lora, since real loras
   carry `loraInfo` (strengthMin/Max) that rgthree clamps against; confirm
   capture and apply both preserve a hand-dragged value end to end. If the
   real drag path stores strength anywhere other than `value.strength`,
   read that and document it.

Registered purely in JS (like core's MarkdownNote) under the type name
`LoraLibrarySetController`; it never executes server-side and never blocks a
queue. It drives a **genuine, untouched `Power Lora Loader (rgthree)`**:

- Widgets: `target` (COMBO of PLL nodes in the graph, by title `#id`, PLUS
  an `All Power Lora Loaders (N)` option when N ≥ 2 — the WAN high/low
  dual-loader case; auto-selects when exactly one exists), the state COMBO
  (internal widget name `set`, displayed label `state`, options from §5
  sets routes — **choosing a state IS the apply**: the combo's callback
  applies immediately, there is NO Apply button; owner decision 2026-07-18
  after the button read as broken; but see the strength-persistence fix —
  selecting must force an apply even when the value is unchanged), `name`
  (text), buttons: `New State`, `Save State`, `Delete State` (two-click
  "Are you sure?" confirm; the armed button is visually distinct, survives
  background cache refreshes for its full window, and selection is
  slug-anchored so a mid-window sets-poll cannot invalidate it — the
  2026-07-18 "delete does nothing during a running workflow" bug), and
  `Push State` (§6.3 broadcast to all Apply LoRA Set nodes).
- Multi-target semantics: with `All…` selected, APPLY writes the set to
  every PLL in the graph; CAPTURE reads from the lowest-node-id PLL (a
  deterministic, documented choice — capture needs one source of truth).
- A read-only `status` line exists for debugging but is HIDDEN by default;
  the node property `Show status` (boolean, default false, in the node's
  right-click Properties) reveals it. Fail-soft states (§ below) must
  surface through toasts/disabled widgets even while status is hidden.
- **Capture** reads the target's lora rows — value shape `{on, lora,
  strength, strengthTwo}` (rgthree) — into a §4 set (`strengthTwo` ⇒
  `strength_clip`; absent ⇒ `null`).
- **Apply** rewrites the target's rows to match the set exactly: row count,
  ORDER, on/off, strengths, then dirties the canvas. Loras missing on this
  machine stay in the row (rgthree shows its own missing-lora state) — the
  user sees the truth rather than a silently shrunken set.
- Feature detection, not version pinning: if the target's widgets don't
  look like PLL rows (no `.value.lora`), the controller disables itself
  with a visible message instead of corrupting widgets. nd-super-nodes'
  `{enabled, strengthClip}` aliases are read (not written) for capture.
- If rgthree isn't installed the node still loads and says so — pointing
  at `LoraLibraryApplySet` as the no-dependency alternative (ethos: the
  ComfyUI-only floor is §6.2; the controller is the upgrade for rgthree
  users).

## §7 Frontend surfaces

- **§7.1 Extension entry** `web/lora_library.js`: exactly one
  `app.registerExtension` call named `lora_library.LoraLibrary`; every
  sub-feature module is wrapped so one failure never blocks the others
  (cpsb pattern). About-panel badge links the GitHub repo and shows the
  frontend version.
- **§7.2 Notebook widget**: two panes inside the node via `addDOMWidget` —
  left: scrolling entry list (click = select → loads text right; shows
  category grouping when present) + `＋ New` / `🗑 Delete`; right: plain
  `<textarea>` + `Save` (disabled until dirty) + a muted status line
  (conflicts per §3.5 surface here with Reload / Overwrite). The node is
  resizable; the widget fills available height. Selection writes the
  `entry` STRING widget so serialization needs no custom code.
  - Multi-select: ctrl/cmd+click toggles an entry in/out of the selection;
    shift+click selects the visible range; plain click collapses to a
    single selection. All selected rows highlight; the EDITOR always shows
    the most recently clicked entry (the "active" one) — editing/saving
    touches only it. The `entry` widget holds the §6.1 newline-joined list.
  - New-below (owner ask 2026-07-19): `＋ New` inserts the new entry
    directly below the ACTIVE entry (via the §5 entry route's `after`),
    in that entry's category — not at end-of-file. With nothing selected it
    appends as before.
  - Rename via the editor header (owner ask 2026-07-19): the editor pane
    has a NAME field at its top showing the active item's name; editing it
    and Saving renames (entries via the entry route's `rename_to`;
    categories via a category-rename — see §6.3 note / add a `rename_to`
    to the category route). This is the PRIMARY rename path because the
    old double-click-inline rename was reported not working; double-click
    now simply focuses this field. Duplicate names refused client-side
    first, server authoritative.
  - Delete removes EVERY selected entry (owner amendment 2026-07-18c): the
    confirm label shows the count when >1 ("Are you sure? (3)"); deletion
    is sequential client-side over the §5 delete route, refreshing
    `base_mtime` from each response; a mid-sequence conflict stops the run
    and surfaces the standard §3.5 conflict UI.
  - Rename: double-click an entry row to edit its name inline (Enter/✓
    commits via the §5 entry route's `rename_to`, Esc cancels; duplicate
    names are refused client-side first, server remains the authority).
  - Categories in the UI (owner ask 2026-07-19): `＋ New` with a name
    STARTING WITH `#` creates a category instead of an entry (the `#` and
    surrounding whitespace are stripped from the stored name). Category
    headers are CLICKABLE and do TWO things at once: (1) toggle
    collapse/expand of that category's entries in the left list (owner ask
    "single tap category name to collapse category"; collapse state is
    UI-only, per-browser, not written to the file), and (2) make the
    category active so the editor pane shows its §3.1 description. Save
    writes the description (and rename via the header name field) through
    the §5 category route — the editor is contextual (entry active ⇒ body;
    category active ⇒ description; the mode hint says which). Category
    selection is UI-only: it never touches the `entry` widget, the entry
    selection set, or the node's outputs. Empty categories render from the
    §5 `categories` list.
  - Multi-select drag into a category (owner ask 2026-07-19): when 2+
    entries are selected, dragging any one of them moves the WHOLE
    selection to the drop target, in selection order (one §5 `/move` per
    entry, or a batch — implementer's choice, but base_mtime is refreshed
    between each so the run doesn't self-conflict).
  - Drag a category header to move the whole category and its entries
    (§3.4 Move category, §5 `/move_category`), with the same insertion
    marker as entry drag.
  - File panel (owner amendment 2026-07-18c, reworked 2026-07-19): the
    panel IS the file control — the raw `file` STRING widget is HIDDEN
    (kept only as the serialized value the node reads; §6.1) and the panel
    replaces it. It shows the RESOLVED absolute path FULL-WIDTH (owner ask:
    "make this full width so it doesn't need to be trimmed"); front-trim
    (keeping the filename) only when the path genuinely overflows the bar,
    full path in tooltip. `Browse…` (picker over §5 `fs/list`, now with
    drive/UNC navigation and a type-a-path input — §5) and `Open folder`
    (§5 `open_folder`). When §5 config reports `is_local: false`, both
    buttons hide, the path becomes read-only, AND the host-machine notice
    ("the host controls which file this node reads") shows on ITS OWN line
    only then (owner ask: separate line, only when needed) — never inline,
    never on load when local.
  - Browse picker: a "type or paste a path" input (accepts any absolute
    path incl. UNC `\\server\share`, applied on Enter/Go), a `..` row that
    climbs to the drive list at a drive root (via §5 `dir="ROOTS"`), and
    the drive list itself — so a NAS/other-drive target is always
    reachable (the 2026-07-19 "couldn't leave C:\" fix).
  - Drag-reorder: rows drag within the list with a visible insertion
    marker; dropping emits one §5 `/notebook/move` (before = the row below
    the marker, or `category` append when dropped at a category's end/on
    its header). §3.5 conflicts surface exactly like Save conflicts.
- **§7.3 Settings**: an "EPSNodes" settings section shows backend +
  frontend versions (mismatch ⇒ "pulled but not restarted" hint, cpsb
  pattern) and the `library_dir` (editable → `POST /config`). Remote
  browsers (§2: a Mac viewing the PC's ComfyUI) DEFER to the host: the
  field displays the server's value, `POST /config` is only attempted when
  the user actually edits it to a DIFFERENT value, and a 403 downgrades to
  a calm "the library folder is controlled by the server machine" notice —
  never an error toast on page load (owner report 2026-07-18).
- **§7.4 Combo freshness**: after any set CRUD the frontend refreshes every
  `LoraLibraryApplySet` node's `set` combo options in place (no page
  reload). Server-side `VALIDATE_INPUTS` already accepts values the combo
  hasn't seen yet.

## §8 Versioning & stability

- Backend version: `lora_library/version.py` (source of truth); frontend:
  `web/lora_library/version.js`; package: `pyproject.toml`. Kept in
  lockstep by `scripts/bump_version.py`; **every push bumps at least the
  patch version and is tagged `vX.Y.Z`** (docs-only changes do not bump —
  version = code-sync signal).
- FROZEN once shipped: node class ids, route paths, the §3 grammar's
  meaning of existing files, and §4 `format: 1` field semantics. New
  capabilities add fields/routes; they do not repurpose old ones.
