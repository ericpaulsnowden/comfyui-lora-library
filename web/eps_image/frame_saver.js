/**
 * @file EPS Frame Saver frontend (FORMAT.md §6.7). Exports the `init()`/
 * `attach(node)`/`loadedGraphNode(node)` hooks `web/eps_image.js` calls; each
 * no-ops for every node type other than `EPSFrameSaver`.
 *
 * Clean-room implementation — this pack is MIT, so nothing here is derived
 * from GPL video-picker prior art (VHS/LNL); the player is built fresh from
 * this pack's OWN proven patterns:
 *
 * - **The Browse dialog** (`openPicker`/`loadPickerDir`/`renderPickerDialog`/
 *   `buildPickerFooter` below) is a trimmed port of `comfyui-premiere-bridge`'s
 *   `web/cprb/nodes.js` `openPicker()` family (itself ported from this pack's
 *   own `web/lora_library/notebook.js` `openBrowsePicker()`), reduced to the
 *   FILE-mode-only shape (no directory-choose mode — this node never picks a
 *   folder): a singleton overlay on `document.body` (never nested in the
 *   node's own DOM, so it isn't clipped by a small node), Escape/backdrop-
 *   click to close, a "type or paste a path" row for UNC/other-drive targets
 *   independent of the server's own drive enumeration, and the `ROOTS`
 *   sentinel's drive-list navigation. Reuses the pack's EXISTING
 *   `GET /lora_library/fs/list` (FORMAT.md §5/STANDARD-fs-browse.md) with
 *   `ext` narrowed to :data:`VIDEO_EXT_PARAM` — no new fs/list route.
 * - **Host-only gating** mirrors both files' identical `GET /lora_library/
 *   config` `is_local` cache/gate (`fetchConfig`/`getConfig`/`refreshGating`
 *   below) — Browse hides and a calm note appears on a remote browser,
 *   exactly like the Notebook/premiere file panels.
 * - **DOM-widget sizing** follows the two proven shapes documented in
 *   `web/lora_library/notebook.js`'s `attachDomWidget()` and
 *   `comfyui-premiere-bridge/web/cprb/nodes.js`'s `attachBarWidget()`:
 *     - **Fill** (the video area, `attachFillWidget` below): `getMinHeight`
 *       only, no `getMaxHeight` — litegraph's widget-arrange pass then gives
 *       this widget whatever height is left after the fixed-height bars
 *       above/below it.
 *     - **Fixed** (the path bar + control strip, `attachFixedWidget` below):
 *       ALL FOUR knobs — `getMinHeight`+`getMaxHeight` (the classic canvas
 *       renderer) AND `computeSize`+`computedHeight` (what cprb's
 *       `attachBarWidget()` found the Vue-node renderer treats as
 *       authoritative instead — "verified live 2026-07-19: the bar
 *       collapsed to ~7px and its buttons clipped past the node's bottom
 *       edge" when only the first two were set) AND the element's own CSS
 *       `height`/`min-height`. Three separate `addDOMWidget` calls (path bar
 *       / video / strip), not one mega-widget with internal flex children —
 *       litegraph arranges DOM widgets top-to-bottom exactly like ordinary
 *       widgets, handing each fixed one its declared height and the one
 *       flexible one everything left over, so three simple single-purpose
 *       widgets compose correctly without needing to fight the layout pass.
 * - **Post-`configure()` resync** follows `eps_image/image_grid.js`'s
 *   `attach()`: `nodeCreated` (this file's `attach()`) fires BEFORE
 *   `LGraphNode.configure()` restores a loaded workflow's real widget
 *   values (`eps_image/resolution.js`'s header: confirmed live and in
 *   `LGraphNode.ts`), so reading `video_path`/`frame` synchronously here
 *   would only ever see their just-constructed defaults. `attach()` below
 *   defers its initial resync one tick (`setTimeout(fn, 0)`, the same
 *   trick `image_grid.js`'s `attach()` uses for its own per-node restore
 *   race) so the current synchronous `configure()` call — if this IS a
 *   workflow load — finishes first. `loadedGraphNode()` (fired once per
 *   node after the WHOLE graph's `configure()` pass completes — the
 *   cross-workflow-load path) and a wrapped `node.onConfigure` (undo/redo,
 *   which re-applies serialized state via `configure()` directly without
 *   re-firing `nodeCreated`) are both belt-and-suspenders re-syncs onto the
 *   same idempotent `fullResync()` — redundant by design, matching
 *   `image_grid.js`'s explicit "all three firing is redundant by design"
 *   stance for the identical class of restore-timing bug.
 *
 * **Two widgets, hidden.** `video_path` (STRING) and `frame` (INT) are the
 * node's real, server-declared, serialized widgets — FORMAT.md §6.7 requires
 * both to round-trip and reach `execute()` untouched by our JS. Both are
 * hidden (`.hidden = true`, the pack-wide "hidden serialized bridge" trick
 * already used for the Notebook's `file`, `EPSSwitcher`'s `toggles`, and
 * `EPSImageGrid`'s `grid_uuid`) and replaced visually by this file's own
 * controls: the path bar's Browse button and the paste-a-path handler both
 * write `video_path`; the control strip's step buttons/number input/playback
 * all write `frame`. Unlike `notebook.js`'s `file` widget, neither needs its
 * OWN wrapped `.callback` for external-change detection — the only writers
 * of `video_path` are this file's Browse picker and paste handler (both
 * funnel through `chooseVideoPath`, which calls `onPathChanged` directly, no
 * callback indirection needed) and a workflow load/undo (`configure()` never
 * invokes widget callbacks at all — it assigns `.value` directly — so a
 * wrapped callback would not even see that case; the three resync hooks
 * above are what actually cover it).
 *
 * **Preview vs. output ("close-enough preview, EXACT frame on output",
 * FORMAT.md §6.7's locked framing).** The `<video>` element gives smooth,
 * native play/pause/loop/seek for scrubbing, but it is ONLY ever a preview:
 * every frame/counter/seek computation here uses `currentTime = frame / fps`
 * against the PROBED `fps`/`frame_count` (`GET /eps_frame_saver/probe`),
 * never the browser's own (possibly VFR-approximate) notion of time. The
 * actual pixels ComfyUI receives always come from `eps_image/
 * frame_saver_video.py`'s `extract_frame` at execution time, independent of
 * whatever the preview happened to show. Two direct consequences below:
 *   - **Exotic codecs degrade gracefully, never hard-fail.** If the browser
 *     can't decode the container/codec, the `<video>` element's `error`
 *     event fires; `state.videoPlayable` flips to `false`, the overlay
 *     switches to a plain message, and playback/seeking are disabled — but
 *     the frame number input, step buttons, and counter stay FULLY
 *     functional (they only need the PROBED fps/frame_count, decoded
 *     server-side by PyAV, completely independent of what Chrome/whatever
 *     browser can render), and Run still extracts the exact frame
 *     regardless. Probing itself failing too (a file PyAV also can't read)
 *     is the one case output would also fail — surfaced as a status line on
 *     the path bar, never a client-side block on Run.
 *   - **Step buttons derive `currentTime` FROM the frame integer
 *     (`frame / fps`), never the reverse.** FORMAT.md §6.7 describes the
 *     step as "`currentTime ± 1/fps`" conceptually (each step moves the
 *     play head by one frame's duration) — implemented here as "increment
 *     the canonical integer frame by 1, then seek to its exact time" rather
 *     than repeatedly nudging `currentTime` by a float `1/fps`, which is
 *     mathematically the same step size but avoids compounding float error
 *     across many successive steps (`setFrame()`/`seekVideoToFrame()`
 *     below).
 *
 * **Playback vs. programmatic seeking don't fight each other.** While the
 * video is actually PLAYING, its own `timeupdate` events are the source of
 * truth for the frame counter (`syncFrameFromPlayback()`) — that path
 * deliberately never re-assigns `video.currentTime` (it was just READ from
 * there), only writes the `frame` widget + updates the number input/counter.
 * A user-driven change (step button, typed number, `configure()`/undo
 * restore) goes through `setFrame()`/`refreshFrameUi({seek:true})` instead,
 * which DOES seek the video to match. Mixing the two (seeking during
 * `timeupdate`) would fight native playback with a constant few-millisecond
 * correction every tick, from the target time never landing exactly back on
 * `currentTime` after a `round()`.
 *
 * **Paste a path onto the node (owner ask 2026-07-21).** Copy a video
 * file's path in Finder ("Copy as Pathname") or Explorer ("Copy as path"),
 * select this node, Ctrl/Cmd+V: the clipboard TEXT becomes `video_path`
 * through the exact same `chooseVideoPath()` a Browse pick uses — one load
 * path, so a pasted file probes, previews, and drives the "Frame X / N"
 * counter identically to a browsed one. Mechanics (implementation under
 * the "Paste a path" section below):
 *   - **DOM `paste` event + `event.clipboardData.getData('text')`, never
 *     `navigator.clipboard.readText()`**: the async Clipboard API is
 *     [SecureContext]-gated — on the owner's Mac viewing the PC over plain
 *     `http://<pc-ip>` it does not even EXIST — while the paste event's
 *     `clipboardData` works there. Same boundary `image_grid.js` documents
 *     for its Copy (FORMAT.md §6.6's Mac fixes) and already solves the
 *     same way for its own paste IN ("0.28.1 / clipboard-API sensitivity"
 *     in its header).
 *   - **Selection-gated, per-instance, cleaned up** (`image_grid.js`'s
 *     `installPasteFiles` idiom, adapted — that node gets selection gating
 *     free from core's `usePaste.ts` FILE routing; TEXT needs our own
 *     listener): each attached node registers one capture-phase `document`
 *     listener that no-ops unless THIS node is the SINGLE selected node
 *     (`app.canvas.selected_nodes`, failing CLOSED) and neither
 *     `event.target` nor `document.activeElement` is a text-entry surface
 *     — so pasting into the Browse dialog's own path input, the frame
 *     number input, or any other field/dialog is never hijacked.
 *     `wireNodeCleanup`'s `onRemoved` wrap removes the listener; no leaked
 *     document listeners.
 *   - **Consume only what is path-shaped.** The text is normalized first
 *     (`cleanPastedVideoPath`: first non-empty line — Finder multi-select
 *     copies one path per line — one pair of wrapping quotes stripped
 *     (Explorer's "Copy as path" double-quotes; shells single-quote), and
 *     `file://` URLs percent-decoded to plain paths incl. the `/C:/`
 *     drive and UNC-host forms). Text that does not clean up to
 *     `looksAbsolutePath` is left entirely alone — NOT consumed — so
 *     core's own paste pipeline (workflow JSON, node paste, ...) still
 *     sees it untouched. A path-shaped paste IS consumed (preventDefault +
 *     stopImmediatePropagation; the capture-phase registration is what
 *     lets that preempt core's earlier-registered bubble-phase `usePaste`
 *     listener): an allowlisted-extension or extensionless path routes to
 *     `chooseVideoPath()` — the probe route stays the REAL validator, its
 *     errors landing on the path bar exactly as for Browse — while a
 *     clearly non-video extension is refused EARLY (toast + path-bar
 *     status naming the allowlist) WITHOUT clobbering the currently-loaded
 *     path with a rejection the server (lockstep list) guarantees anyway.
 *   - **Remote viewers change nothing here**: the pasted path writes the
 *     widget exactly like a workflow-loaded path would, and
 *     `refreshVideoSource`'s existing `isLocal === false` short-circuit
 *     skips probe/stream and shows the host-only overlay — Run still
 *     works, since the SERVER is what reads the path at execute() time.
 *     The asymmetry with Browse (hidden when remote) is deliberate: Browse
 *     needs the server to LIST folders for you, paste needs nothing from
 *     the server until probe time — and the owner's usual viewer (Mac →
 *     PC over LAN) is exactly the remote case pasting must keep working
 *     in.
 * The cleanup/verdict helpers are pure and exported;
 * `tests/test_frame_saver_paste_js.py` drives them under Node (the
 * `test_resolution_grid_js.py` fixture pattern) and locks the JS ext
 * allowlist to `routes_frame_saver.py`'s tuple.
 *
 * Vanilla ES modules, no build step, matching the rest of this pack.
