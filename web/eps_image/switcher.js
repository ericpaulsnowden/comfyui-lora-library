/**
 * @file EPS Switcher frontend (FORMAT.md §6.4). Exports the `init()`/
 * `attach(node)` hooks `web/eps_image.js` calls; `attach` no-ops for every
 * node type other than `EPSSwitcher`.
 *
 * Three pieces, each borrowed from a proven pattern already in the
 * comfy_ps monorepo (cited FORMAT.md §6.4 asks for exactly these two
 * borrows) but reimplemented here with no runtime dependency on either
 * source:
 *
 * 1. **Growing `image_N` sockets** -- a direct structural port of
 *    comfyui-premiere-bridge's `web/cprb/nodes.js`
 *    `convergeVideoInputs`/`wireVideoInputGrowth` (video_N -> image_N).
 *    Same invariant: every CONNECTED `image_N` keeps its name/link
 *    untouched (never renumbered, a disconnected MIDDLE slot is left as a
 *    gap), and exactly one trailing EMPTY slot exists at all times, one
 *    past the highest connected `image_N`. Same double-hook shape
 *    (`configure` + `onConnectionsChange`) for the same reason: litegraph's
 *    own `configure()` restore loop
 *    (`LGraphNode.ts` -- see cprb/nodes.js's citation of the exact lines)
 *    calls `onConnectionsChange` once per restored slot with `isConnected`
 *    HARDCODED `true`, even for a slot whose own `.link` is `null` --
 *    reacting to that directly would misgrow on every workflow load/undo/
 *    paste, so a `state.restoring` guard blanks `onConnectionsChange`
 *    for exactly the duration of THIS node's own `configure()` call, and a
 *    single converge pass runs in `finally` once `this.inputs` is stable.
 *
 *    **Round-10 dead-rewire fix**: the LIVE `onConnectionsChange` path (a
 *    real user drag, not `configure()`) now SCHEDULES `convergeImageInputs`
 *    via `setTimeout(fn, 0)` instead of calling it synchronously, guarded so
 *    a burst of events coalesces into one deferred run (`wireImageInputGrowth`
 *    below). Root cause investigated per owner report ("rewiring a socket
 *    that was disconnected while toggled off goes dead"): `LGraphNode.ts`'s
 *    `removeInput(slot)` (~1726) calls `this.disconnectInput(slot, true)`
 *    FIRST, and `disconnectInput` (~3240) itself dispatches
 *    `this.onConnectionsChange?.(...)` (~3321) BEFORE it returns -- so the
 *    trailing-collapse case (disconnecting the HIGHEST connected `image_N`,
 *    where 2+ trailing empties must collapse to 1) previously called
 *    `node.removeInput()` on that SAME slot SYNCHRONOUSLY from inside
 *    litegraph's own `disconnectInput` call for that slot, splicing
 *    `this.inputs` while litegraph (and whatever mouse-gesture code called
 *    `disconnectInput`) was still mid-call on it. Live-verified with real
 *    drags against the dev rig's frontend (ComfyUI 0.28.0 /
 *    comfyui-frontend-package 1.45.21): this specific reentrant splice did
 *    NOT corrupt `this.inputs` there (nothing after the `onConnectionsChange`
 *    dispatch inside `disconnectInput` re-touches the slot by index; verified
 *    by reading to the end of the function) -- both the middle-gap and
 *    trailing-collapse disconnect/rewire sequences below (see `attach`'s
 *    call sites) worked via real mouse drags every time, and a queued fan-out
 *    run afterward produced the correct output count. The bug therefore
 *    could NOT be reproduced on 1.45.21. It is exactly the kind of
 *    internal-timing assumption that can differ on another frontend build
 *    (the owner's ComfyUI 0.28.1, never re-verified here -- see the file-level
 *    0.28.1 caveat), so deferring the restructuring past the entire
 *    synchronous mouse-event chain is shipped anyway, defensively: by the
 *    time the `setTimeout` fires, no litegraph-internal call frame is still
 *    holding a slot index or input reference into `this.inputs`, so the
 *    restructuring can never race a caller that assumes indices stay put.
 *    `configure()`'s own post-restore converge above is UNCHANGED (still
 *    synchronous, in `finally`, once per `configure()` call) -- that path is
 *    never nested inside a live litegraph mutation, so deferring it would
 *    only add risk (e.g. a paste/undo immediately followed by another
 *    `configure()` before the deferred call fires) for no benefit.
 *
 * 2. **Per-row on/off toggle** -- rgthree Power Lora Loader's per-row dot
 *    (`web/comfyui/power_lora_loader.js` `PowerLoraLoaderWidget.onToggleDown`)
 *    is UX borrowed, not code: PLL's rows are pure WIDGETS (a lora's
 *    on/off/strength lives entirely in a widget value, no real graph
 *    socket involved), so its click dispatch rides litegraph's built-in
 *    custom-widget `mouse()` protocol. Our `image_N` rows are REAL input
 *    sockets (actual image data has to flow through them), and sockets
 *    aren't part of that widget dispatch at all -- so the toggle here is
 *    drawn and hit-tested by hand, hooking `onDrawForeground`/`onMouseDown`
 *    directly (verified against a local ComfyUI_frontend 1.45.21 TS
 *    checkout, `src/lib/litegraph/src/`):
 *      - `LGraphCanvas.ts` (~2930) calls `node.onMouseDown?.(e, pos, this)`
 *        with `pos = [x - node.pos[0], y - node.pos[1])` -- but ONLY after
 *        an earlier input/output hit-test in the same function has already
 *        failed (comment there: "Click was inside the node, but not on
 *        input/output, or resize area"). So a toggle box can never be drawn
 *        ON TOP of an input's own clickable region, or the click would
 *        never reach `onMouseDown` at all.
 *      - That input hit-region is wide: `canvas/measureSlots.ts`
 *        `getNodeInputOnPos` reserves `20 + nameLength*7` px starting 10px
 *        left of the socket dot (~70-90px for a name like `image_12`) --
 *        so the toggle box is drawn LEFT-anchored, just past that reserved
 *        width (`drawRowToggles()`'s `boxX`, computed per row from the
 *        input's own name length), rather than from the node's right edge.
 *        An early version
 *        anchored from the right instead and visually collided with the
 *        node's single `images` OUTPUT label (live-verify screenshot,
 *        2026-07-19 rig session) -- that label's TEXT extends further left
 *        than its ~40px `getNodeOutputOnPos` hit-region alone would
 *        suggest, so a right-anchored margin big enough to clear the click
 *        zone was still not big enough to clear the drawn text. Anchoring
 *        from the left of each row (always well clear of the lone output,
 *        which only ever occupies the row-0 slot on the opposite edge)
 *        sidesteps the whole text-vs-hit-region distinction.
 *        `ensureMinNodeWidth` keeps enough room for this on any node width.
 *      - Row Y comes from `node.getConnectionPos(true, slotIndex)` (graph
 *        coords) minus `node.pos` -- the OLD/deprecated-but-still-present
 *        API, preferred here over the newer `getInputPos` specifically
 *        because it predates this fork's TS rewrite and is far more likely
 *        to exist unchanged on the owner's ComfyUI 0.28.1 frontend (see the
 *        file-level 0.28.1 caveat below).
 *
 * 3. **Header tri-state "toggle all"** -- PLL's header widget
 *    (`PowerLoraLoaderHeaderWidget`) draws itself via the SAME legacy
 *    custom-widget contract litegraph has supported for years: a plain
 *    widget object with `.type`, `.draw(ctx, node, width, y, height)`, and
 *    `.mouse(event, pos, node)`, added via `node.addCustomWidget(...)`.
 *    Unlike the per-row toggles, this one rides that stock dispatch
 *    (`LGraphNode.ts` `drawWidgets`: `if (typeof widget.draw ===
 *    'function') widget.draw(...)`; `LGraphCanvas.ts`
 *    `processWidgetClick`: `else if (widget.mouse) widget.mouse(...)`,
 *    labeled "Legacy custom widget callback" in that source -- i.e. this is
 *    the OLD, most-portable litegraph widget shape, safer across frontend
 *    versions than the newer `addTitleButton`/`title_buttons` API this
 *    fork also has). One wrinkle confirmed against that same source:
 *    `processWidgetClick` calls `widget.mouse()` TWICE per click -- once on
 *    mousedown, once again in `pointer.finally` replaying the mouseup
 *    event -- so `HEADER_WIDGET.mouse()` below only acts when
 *    `event.type` ends in "down", or a single click would toggle-all twice
 *    (a no-op that looks like the header silently does nothing).
 *    Positionally the header widget lands in the WIDGET stack, which
 *    litegraph always lays out below every input/output socket -- there is
 *    no supported way to place a widget above the growing `image_N` row
 *    stack, so "header" here means "first (only) widget, directly under
 *    the last image_N socket" rather than literally above the title. This
 *    is a deliberate M1 trade-off, not an oversight.
 *
 * 4. **Renamable rows** (round-10, FORMAT.md §6.4 "Renamable rows") --
 *    double-clicking an `image_N` row opens `LGraphCanvas.prompt` (confirmed
 *    present on this fork; falls back to `window.prompt` otherwise) and
 *    sets `input.label`, display-only: `input.name` and every `toggles` key
 *    stay the frozen `image_N` (backend contract untouched -- confirmed live
 *    by inspecting the actual `/prompt` payload a queued run sends: it
 *    carries only names, never a label). Two hooks cover the whole row
 *    because litegraph dispatches double-clicks differently depending on
 *    WHERE they land: `onInputDblClick(index, e)` fires for a click within
 *    litegraph's OWN input hit-region (the socket dot and its name/label
 *    text -- `LGraphCanvas.ts`'s inputs loop registers this and `return`s
 *    before reaching anything else); `onDblClick(e, pos, canvas)` fires for
 *    a click anywhere ELSE in the node body -- our toggle checkbox (point 2
 *    above; deliberately outside that same input hit-region) or blank row
 *    space. Both were live-verified (real double-clicks, both a connected
 *    row and the trailing spare). The header widget's own clicks are
 *    dispatched through a third, earlier branch (`getWidgetOnPos` /
 *    `processWidgetClick`), so `onDblClick` never fires for it; the title
 *    bar is excluded explicitly (`pos[1] < 0`, litegraph's own signal for
 *    "this was the title"). `drawRowToggles` (point 2) measures `label ||
 *    name` (not just `name`) for its width math, matching
 *    `measureSlots.ts`'s own precedence, so a long label can't collide with
 *    the toggle box. **Persistence**: FORMAT.md §6.4 asks to verify
 *    `input.label` survives save/reload before trusting it, with a
 *    node-property fallback if the fork drops it. Confirmed unnecessary
 *    here on two levels: `node/slotUtils.ts`'s `inputAsSerialisable`
 *    (called from `LGraphNode.serialize()`) explicitly destructures `label`
 *    into the serialized POJO, and a live round trip (rename a connected
 *    row AND the spare, reload the page, re-read `node.inputs[i].label`)
 *    came back unchanged both times. Plain `input.label` is therefore the
 *    only mechanism used -- no node-property map.
 *
 * **`toggles` is the enabled-set bridge to the backend** (module docstring,
 * `eps_image/nodes_switcher.py`): a hidden (`.hidden = true`, same trick
 * FORMAT.md §7.2 uses for the Prompt Notebook's `file` widget) STRING
 * widget holding a JSON object of `{"image_N": false}` overrides -- absent
 * key means enabled. Every toggle/connection-change call here keeps it in
 * lockstep so the backend's filtering (which is authoritative; this file
 * only drives what the backend already trusts) always matches what's on
 * screen, and pruned to slots that still exist so it never grows unbounded
 * across many connect/disconnect cycles.
 *
 * **0.28.1 caveat**: this file was built and live-verified against the dev
 * rig's ComfyUI 0.28.0 / `comfyui-frontend-package` 1.45.21. Every litegraph
 * API used above is checked against that fork's TS source directly (see
 * citations); `getConnectionPos`, `onDrawForeground`, `onMouseDown`,
 * `addCustomWidget`, and the legacy `draw`/`mouse` widget contract are all
 * old, pre-rewrite APIs kept for backward compatibility, so they are the
 * LOW-risk choices here -- but this was not re-verified against whatever
 * frontend version ships with the owner's ComfyUI 0.28.1, and every failure
 * path below is a `console.warn` + graceful no-op rather than a thrown
 * error, on purpose.
