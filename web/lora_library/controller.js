/**
 * @file EPS Lora Loader State Controller — frontend-only virtual node
 * (FORMAT.md §6.3) that drives a genuine, untouched `Power Lora Loader
 * (rgthree)` node elsewhere in the graph. Registered purely in JS (like
 * core's MarkdownNote/NoteNode) — never executes, never appears in the API
 * prompt.
 *
 * Renamed a THIRD time 2026-07-22 (owner: every node's display name
 * must start with "EPS" so a gallery search for "EPS" surfaces the
 * whole pack): "Lora Loader State Controller" -> "EPS Lora Loader
 * State Controller". As before ONLY `NODE_TITLE` changed; the class
 * id stays FROZEN.
 *
 * Renamed from "LoRA Set Controller" (owner, 2026-07-18c): every user-facing
 * word now says "state" instead of "set" — button labels, the `set` widget's
 * on-canvas text, placeholders, toasts. The class id
 * `LoraLibrarySetController` and the backend `sets` storage/routes stay
 * FROZEN (FORMAT.md §6.3/§8) and keep saying "set" underneath — internal
 * identifiers (variables, methods, the widget's `name`, the
 * `lora_library:sets-changed` DOM event sets.js listens for) are
 * DELIBERATELY left alone so this stays a pure vocabulary change with zero
 * behavioral or serialization risk. See the `label` vs `name` bullet below
 * for the one widget where that distinction is load-bearing.
 *
 * Renamed AGAIN 2026-07-19 (owner: drop "Power" — "Power Lora Loader State
 * Controller" -> "Lora Loader State Controller"). Only `NODE_TITLE` changed:
 * the TARGET node this file drives is still genuinely titled "Power Lora
 * Loader (rgthree)", so every other "Power Lora Loader" string below
 * describes THAT node, not this one. Same owner report, two more fixes in
 * this same pass:
 *  (1) "Save State doesn't work; re-picking reverts to original strengths" —
 *      root-caused and fixed as two parts, LIVE-VERIFIED against the rig
 *      (comfyui-test, port 8199): see `_hookSetValueForReselect()` (a
 *      same-value re-pick in the `set` combo provably never reaches its
 *      callback on this fork — confirmed by reading the exact installed
 *      `BaseWidget.setValue` in comfyui-frontend-package 1.45.21) and
 *      `_doUpdate()`'s post-save re-apply. Capture itself was NOT at fault —
 *      `captureRows()` already reads the live, in-place-mutated
 *      `widget.value.strength`/`.strengthTwo` rgthree's real strength-drag
 *      handler writes (`power_lora_loader.js` `doOnStrengthAnyMove`/
 *      `stepStrength`), confirmed with an actual pointer drag on the rig.
 *  (2) Added the `Push State` button — broadcasts the selected state to
 *      every `LoraLibraryApplySet` node in the graph; see `_doPush()`.
 *
 * 2026-07-19c hardening (owner report AGAIN, this time on ComfyUI 0.28.1 —
 * "strengths are still not saved or updated"). (1) above shadowed
 * `BaseWidget.setValue` on the `set` widget INSTANCE. That shadow is correct
 * on THIS rig's exact frontend build (comfyui-frontend-package 1.45.21,
 * re-verified below, same file/lines as before) but is not a portable fix:
 * a different frontend build on the owner's 0.28.1 install can lay out
 * `ComboWidget`/`BaseWidget` differently enough that the shadow point
 * silently stops applying, and the regression looks IDENTICAL to the
 * original bug. Three changes replace it:
 *  (3) VERSION-PROOF SELECTION — `_hookSetValueForReselect()` is REMOVED.
 *      `_hookSetWidgetMenu()` / `_openSetMenu()` / `_onSetPicked()` replace
 *      it: the controller now owns the `set` widget's CLICK, not its VALUE
 *      SETTER. Re-verified against the same rig bundle cited above
 *      (static/assets/api-BqIxvqZ8.js):
 *        - `LGraphCanvas.processWidgetClick(e, node, widget)` (fired from
 *          widget hit-testing on pointer-down) resolves
 *          `c = toConcreteWidget(widget, node, false)` and only DEFERS the
 *          actual click: `pointer.onClick = () => c.onClick({e, node,
 *          canvas: this})`, invoked later by `CanvasPointer._completeClick`
 *          on pointer-up-without-drag.
 *        - `toConcreteWidget(e, node, promote)` starts with
 *          `if (e instanceof BaseWidget) return e`. `LGraphNode.addWidget()`
 *          itself already routes the raw `{type,name,value,...}` data
 *          through `toConcreteWidget` inside `addCustomWidget()` and
 *          pushes/returns THAT result (a real `ComboWidget` instance), never
 *          the raw data — so the object `this.addWidget('combo', ...)` hands
 *          back to us IS ALREADY that instance, and `c === widget` above,
 *          every time, with no proxy or fresh wrapper in between. Shadowing
 *          `.onClick` as an own property on that exact instance is therefore
 *          a stable, version-proof override: unlike `setValue`, there is no
 *          second internal (a `callback` option, a same-value branch) for a
 *          future frontend build to reintroduce this same failure through.
 *        - Stock `ComboWidget.onClick` — the method being replaced — is
 *          itself nothing more than `new LiteGraph.ContextMenu(values, {
 *          scale, event, className:'dark', callback: v => this.setValue(v,
 *          {e,node,canvas}) })`. `_openSetMenu()` below is that exact
 *          mechanism with the `setValue` detour removed, not a foreign
 *          technique bolted on. Further precedent for a node pack calling
 *          `LiteGraph.ContextMenu` directly: rgthree's OWN lora-row
 *          right-click menu (power_lora_loader.js
 *          `RgthreePowerLoraLoader.getSlotMenuOptions`, `new
 *          LiteGraph.ContextMenu(menuItems, {title, event})`).
 *        - `ContextMenu`'s per-item click (its `inner_onclick`) invokes
 *          `options.callback.call(itemEl, pickedValue, options, domEvent,
 *          menuInstance)` — `pickedValue` is exactly the array element we
 *          passed in, the identical shape the stock widget's own callback
 *          above receives — so `_openSetMenu()`'s callback getting the
 *          picked LABEL string as its one argument is guaranteed by the same
 *          code path the stock widget relies on, not an assumption.
 *      Net effect: EVERY menu pick — including re-picking the state already
 *      showing — runs `_onSetPicked()` unconditionally. There is no
 *      same-value branch anywhere in this path to route around, because
 *      `BaseWidget.setValue` (the only place that branch lives) is never
 *      called for a user pick anymore. The `_isRestoring`/`_silentSetWrite`
 *      guard fields and the `configure()` override that bracketed them are
 *      REMOVED as a consequence, not merely left unused: they existed only
 *      to stop a programmatic `.value =` write from being mistaken for a
 *      real pick THROUGH THE OLD CALLBACK/setValue path. With that path
 *      gone, a plain assignment structurally cannot reach `_onSetPicked()`
 *      — see the "Combo callbacks do NOT fire during workflow restore"
 *      bullet below, updated to match.
 *  (4) READ-BACK TOAST — `_toastRowsSaved()`. `New State`/`Save State` now
 *      follow their write with a real `GET /lora_library/set?slug=`
 *      (FORMAT.md §5) and toast what the FILE holds, not what the button
 *      THINKS it sent — a wrong `captureRows()` read on a different rgthree
 *      build, or any backend-side transform, shows up in the toast text
 *      itself. `captureRows()`'s per-field fallback chain was also widened
 *      (still read-only, still never writes an alias back). `Show status`
 *      (still hidden by default) additionally names the capture-source
 *      loader id + row count on every capture/save — see `_setStatusText()`.
 *  (5) SELECTIVE PUSH — FORMAT.md §6.2's `mirrors loader` tag, written by
 *      the sibling `sets.js` on every `LoraLibraryApplySet` node. `_doPush()`
 *      now reads the controller's OWN `target` combo to decide WHICH Apply
 *      nodes to touch: a specific Power Lora Loader target restricts the
 *      push to Apply nodes tagged to that same node (plus any tagged
 *      "(any)"); `All…` pushes to every Apply node regardless of tag. See
 *      `selectPushTargets()`/`mirrorsTagMatches()`. Deliberately still
 *      independent of `probeTargets()` (rgthree health) — a push never
 *      touches rgthree, so it keeps working with rgthree uninstalled or the
 *      target unhealthy, exactly as before this amendment.
 *
 * 2026-07-20 (round 10, owner report on v0.14.0): "Isn't working. Strength
 * is always 1.0." for BOTH `sc-save-state-overwrites` and `sc-readback-toast`
 * — the read-back toast (4 above) is doing exactly its job: it shows what
 * CAPTURE actually read, and on the owner's machine that is a flat 1.0
 * regardless of the dragged on-screen value, even though APPLY (3 above),
 * Push State, and selective Push all still work for him. Investigation:
 *  - The rig's rgthree-comfy checkout was diffed BYTE-FOR-BYTE (2026-07-20)
 *    against `raw.githubusercontent.com/rgthree/rgthree-comfy/main/web/
 *    comfyui/power_lora_loader.js` — zero differences; this rig is running
 *    current upstream `main`. `PowerLoraLoaderWidget` stores its row as a
 *    plain `{on, lora, strength, strengthTwo}` object behind a plain
 *    get/set pair (`set value(v) { this._value = v }`), mutated IN PLACE by
 *    the real drag handler (`doOnStrengthAnyMove`: `this.value[prop] =
 *    (this.value[prop] ?? 1) + event.deltaX * 0.05`) — exactly what
 *    `captureRows()` already assumed and what R4-R9 verified with a real
 *    pointer drag on this rig. Could NOT reproduce the owner's exact
 *    symptom against this code — see the final "HONEST GAP" bullet.
 *  - ComfyUI_frontend's OWN `LGraphNode.serialize()` (src/lib/litegraph/src/
 *    LGraphNode.ts, the `widgets_values`-building loop, ~lines 984-990)
 *    reads `widget.value` directly too, for the workflow-SAVE path — but it
 *    round-trips any object value through `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(val))`,
 *    with the code comment "Ensure object values are plain (not reactive
 *    proxies) for structuredClone compatibility." That is this frontend's
 *    OWN authors documenting that `.value` is not guaranteed to be the plain
 *    object rgthree constructs on every widget/render path — precisely the
 *    class of skew a newer or differently-configured frontend build (the
 *    owner is on ComfyUI 0.28.1; this rig is verified against
 *    comfyui-frontend-package 1.45.21) could introduce without rgthree
 *    itself changing one line.
 *  - A DIFFERENT frontend path, `executionUtil.ts` (the API-PROMPT-building
 *    path, not the workflow-save path above, ~lines 103-104), goes further:
 *    `widget.serializeValue ? await widget.serializeValue(node, i) :
 *    widget.value` — i.e. ComfyUI_frontend's own code PREFERS a widget's
 *    `serializeValue()` over raw `.value`, wherever a widget defines one,
 *    for this exact reason. rgthree's `PowerLoraLoaderWidget.serializeValue
 *    (node, index)` DOES define one: `{...this.value}` (spreading into a
 *    fresh object literal always yields a plain one, proxied source or not)
 *    with `strengthTwo` deleted in single-strength mode or defaulted to 1 in
 *    dual mode. That is rgthree's OWN stated choice of "the value an
 *    outside reader should trust" — not a foreign technique bolted on, the
 *    same seam ComfyUI_frontend itself already relies on for this exact
 *    widget.
 *  - THE FIX: `captureRows()` (see its own updated doc comment and
 *    `readRowSources()`) now reads BOTH sources per row and prefers
 *    `serializeValue()`'s fields when it returns a usable object, falling
 *    back to the existing `.value`-based alias chain field-by-field
 *    otherwise — a widening, not a replacement: on any rgthree without a
 *    working `serializeValue` (including THIS rig's) this produces
 *    byte-identical output to before; on any environment where the two
 *    sources diverge, this reads the one both rgthree and ComfyUI_frontend
 *    already trust more. Every strength is then coerced through `Number()`
 *    (`coerceStrength()`); a non-numeric result is reported by row name via
 *    `console.warn` and replaced with a safe fallback rather than silently
 *    writing garbage into a saved state file. `serializeValue()` is awaited
 *    (its type allows returning a `Promise`, per ComfyUI_frontend's
 *    `simplifiedWidget.ts`), so `captureRows()` is now `async` — both call
 *    sites (`_doCapture`/`_doUpdate`) already `await` other calls in the
 *    same function, so this is a non-breaking signature change internal to
 *    this file.
 *  - DIAGNOSTICS: new `Debug capture` node property (default false,
 *    alongside `Show status`). Every capture now `console.debug`s one
 *    compact line per row (`.value` strength vs `serializeValue()` strength
 *    vs the strength actually used, and which source won) UNCONDITIONALLY —
 *    no property to flip, so the very next mismatch report already has this
 *    trail in the console with zero setup. With `Debug capture` on, a full
 *    `console.table()` of every row's raw `.value` + `serializeValue()`
 *    objects is additionally logged, for the rarer case the compact line
 *    can't resolve alone.
 *  - HONEST GAP: none of the above could be LIVE-verified against the
 *    owner's exact ComfyUI 0.28.1 install and his exact installed rgthree
 *    commit — this rig has neither, and rgthree ships no version tags to
 *    pin against (its GitHub releases list is a single 2023 entry; it is
 *    developed and distributed straight off `main`). The fix is reasoned
 *    from cited, current source in both projects, not from a rig-side
 *    repro of the 1.0 symptom itself. It is still the right bet: it can only
 *    ever be MORE correct than the old read (identical on this rig, better
 *    anywhere the two sources diverge), it costs nothing when the two agree,
 *    and it now leaves a console trail specific enough that if the owner's
 *    next report is still "1.0," the `console.debug`/`console.table` output
 *    will show definitively whether `serializeValue()` itself is returning
 *    1.0 (an rgthree-side or 0.28.1-side issue upstream of this file) or
 *    whether something else is happening (e.g. the wrong node/row being
 *    read) — either way narrowing the next round instead of re-guessing.
 *
 * 2026-07-20 (§4.1 composite fix, owner: "All Power Lora Loaders currently
 * reads only the lowest-id loader and writes that ONE config to ALL
 * loaders; I want each loader to keep its OWN distinct set, captured/
 * restored together" — same root cause as "two EPS Apply LoRA Set nodes on
 * different loaders show identical loras_text", fixed on the ApplySet side
 * by nodes_sets.py's new `loader_slot`). FORMAT.md §4.1 adds a `loaders[]`
 * array to the §4 set-file schema for exactly this case; this file's half:
 *  - CAPTURE (`_doCapture()`/`_doUpdate()`, now delegating to
 *    `_captureComposite()`/`_updateComposite()` for target "All Power Lora
 *    Loaders (N)", N>=2): every PLL's rows, in ascending-node-id order
 *    (`resolveTargetNodes()` already sorts "All…" that way), become one
 *    `loaders[i]` each — via the SAME `captureRows()` this file has used
 *    since v0.14.1, called once per loader, completely unmodified. The
 *    single-target path (every OTHER target value) is a pure ADDITION
 *    guarded by `targets.length > 1` — the owner-validated capture/strength
 *    read for one loader runs through zero new code.
 *  - APPLY (`_doApply()`, via the now composite-aware
 *    `applySetToTargets()`): a format-2 state's `loaders[i]` goes to the
 *    i-th PLL by ascending id for an "All…" target (fewer loaders than
 *    PLLs -> extras left untouched + a toast names the mismatch, never
 *    guessed); for a SINGLE specific-PLL target, the slice is that PLL's
 *    ascending-id RANK AMONG EVERY PLL IN THE GRAPH (`pllAscendingIndex()`)
 *    — not its (always-0) position within a 1-element `targets` array. A
 *    format-1 state (no `loaders`) takes the exact pre-existing path either
 *    way — `isComposite` short-circuits every new branch.
 *  - PUSH STATE (`_doPush()`): unchanged in scope — still broadcasts the
 *    selected slug to every selected Apply node exactly as before. As a
 *    strictly best-effort ADDITION (`_syncLoaderSlotsForPush()`, wrapped in
 *    the new `_guardedAsync()`), a composite push also sets each pushed
 *    Apply node's `loader_slot` from its `mirrors loader` tag's
 *    ascending-id index, so a WAN pair of tagged Apply nodes needs no
 *    manual "reveal loader_slot and set it to 1" step. This runs AFTER the
 *    push count is already computed and can never affect it, is skipped
 *    outright for a format-1 push, and any failure inside it is caught and
 *    logged rather than surfaced — chosen deliberately over baking this
 *    into `pushStateToNode()` itself, to keep the validated core broadcast
 *    (`pushStateToNodes()`) exactly as it was.
 *  - `lorasForLoaderIndex()` is this file's hand-kept-in-sync mirror of
 *    `sets_store.py`'s `loras_for_slot()` — same "no cross-language import"
 *    convention as every other duplicated constant here (e.g.
 *    `APPLY_SET_WIDGET_NAME`).
 *
 * 2026-07-21 (TWO-PANE layout, owner ask, FORMAT.md §6.3 "TWO-PANE layout"
 * bullet — "just the two-pane layout," explicitly no file/Browse panel this
 * round): the `set` state COMBO (built + owned end-to-end by the
 * 2026-07-19c hardening above) is replaced by a Notebook-style two-pane DOM
 * widget (`_buildStatePane()`) — LEFT: a scrolling `<div>` list of every
 * saved state, one row per `_setsCache` entry, the current selection
 * highlighted; RIGHT: the four action buttons stacked vertically. This
 * mirrors `web/lora_library/notebook.js`'s own two-pane editor (FORMAT.md
 * §7.2) function-for-function, not just in spirit: `_renderStateList()` is
 * this file's `renderList()`/`buildEntryRow()` (list rebuild, per-row
 * click+keydown, an `llsc-row-active` highlight class in place of
 * Notebook's `.llnb-entry-active`); `_buildStatePane()`'s `addDOMWidget(...)`
 * call is Notebook's `attachDomWidget()` (identical `hideOnZoom`/
 * `serialize:false`/`serializeValue: () => undefined`/`getMinHeight`-only
 * shape, so the panel fills the node and never collapses to a sliver,
 * exactly per Notebook's own verified citation for that mechanism — not
 * re-derived here, just reused); `el()` below is a hand-copied twin of
 * Notebook's own tiny DOM-builder helper (this file had zero DOM-
 * construction code before today — nothing to import, so it's copied, same
 * "duplicated by hand, no cross-module coupling" convention as every other
 * shared-shape constant/helper in this file, e.g. `APPLY_SET_WIDGET_NAME`
 * above); `injectControllerStyles()`/`STATE_PANE_CSS_TEXT` is Notebook's
 * `injectStyles()`/`CSS_TEXT` twin, under a DISTINCT `<style>` tag id and an
 * `llsc-` class prefix (vs. Notebook's `llnb-`) so the two style sheets
 * never collide in the shared `document.head`.
 *
 * Row-click semantics as FIRST built that day: clicking a list row WAS the
 * apply, unconditionally, even on the already-selected row (the exact
 * semantics the combo had per the 2026-07-19/2026-07-19c strength-
 * persistence fixes above) — SUPERSEDED the SAME DAY by the owner's
 * select-vs-apply split; see the 2026-07-21b section below for the
 * two-step semantics `_onSetPicked()` implements now. What this paragraph
 * still accurately records is the CLICK PLUMBING, which the split did not
 * change: the row's plain DOM `click` handler calls `_onSetPicked(entry.
 * label)` directly, and the APPLY branch inside it still reaches
 * `_onSetSelected()`/`_doApply()` with no same-value branch anywhere in
 * the path — an apply-click on the already-showing state re-applies
 * exactly like the old combo pick did. This is a STRENGTHENING of the
 * 2026-07-19c hardening's own goal, not just a UI change:
 * `_hookSetWidgetMenu()`/`_openSetMenu()` are REMOVED OUTRIGHT this round
 * (not merely superseded — there is no combo left to hook a click onto),
 * because a plain DOM element's `click`/`keydown` listener touches ZERO
 * litegraph widget internals — no `ComboWidget`, no `BaseWidget.onClick`, no
 * `LiteGraph.ContextMenu` — so the entire CLASS of "a different frontend
 * build lays out widget internals differently" risk that motivated
 * 2026-07-19c's `onClick`-shadowing design in the first place (see that
 * section's own citation trail below — still an accurate record of why THAT
 * design was necessary at the time, not rewritten) is now structurally
 * inapplicable to state selection: there is nothing version-sensitive left
 * to bind to. `_setComboValues()` is removed as dead code (no combo left to
 * feed values to); `_renderStateList()` reads `_setsCache` directly instead,
 * which is what every label string was always sourced from underneath the
 * combo anyway.
 *
 * Serialization (FORMAT.md §6.3: "keep the internal `set` STRING widget,
 * hidden, driven by the list selection — the Notebook's `entry`-widget
 * trick"): `_w.set` changes TYPE from `'combo'` to `'text'` and gains
 * `.hidden = true` (the same first-class litegraph layout primitive this
 * file already cites for `status` below, and Notebook's own header cites
 * for its `file` widget — a real hide, not a value-blank). The widget's
 * `name` stays the frozen literal `'set'` — unchanged, so every existing
 * "kept in sync by hand" consumer of that name elsewhere, and the
 * save/restore positional-index contract documented below, are unaffected
 * by the type change. `_w.set` stays in the SERIALIZED group, declared
 * before `status` (which stays `serialize:false`) — the save/restore
 * ordering invariant documented below is unaffected: the split is still
 * target+set+name (serialized) then status+the-DOM-widget (not), in that
 * order. Restore still goes through `configure()`'s plain
 * `widget.value = ...` assignment (LGraphNode.ts, cited below) for EVERY
 * widget type, not only `ComboWidget` — so the "combo callbacks do NOT fire
 * during workflow restore" guarantee documented below is, if anything, on
 * firmer ground for a plain text widget than it was for the combo (one
 * fewer subclass layer between `BaseWidget`'s value setter and this
 * widget). VERIFY(live) regardless: re-confirm empirically (reload a saved
 * workflow, watch it NOT re-apply) rather than resting on that reasoning
 * alone — this file's own hard-won lesson from 2026-07-19c is that
 * litegraph internals are exactly the kind of thing to verify live, never
 * assume.
 *
 * The four buttons move from canvas `addWidget('button', ...)` widgets into
 * real `<button>` elements in the DOM widget's right pane
 * (`_createActionButton()`, replacing the removed `_addButton()`); every
 * click is now wrapped in `_guarded()` (a strengthening — previously only
 * Delete's click was explicitly re-guarded at the call site).
 * `_onCaptureClick()`/`_onUpdateClick()`/`_onDeleteClick()`/`_onPushClick()`
 * and everything they call (`_doCapture`/`_doUpdate`/`_doApply`/`_doDelete`/
 * `_doPush`, composite capture/apply, selective Push, the read-back toasts)
 * are UNTOUCHED — this change only alters how a click REACHES those
 * methods, never what they do once reached. The two-click delete-confirm
 * (2026-07-18c) keeps its exact constants (`DELETE_CONFIRM_MS`,
 * `DELETE_ARMED_BG_COLOR`/`_TEXT_COLOR`) and its exact arm/disarm timing and
 * slug-anchoring (`_selectedSetEntry()` is still called at arm time,
 * unchanged) — only the PAINT mechanism changes: from
 * `Object.defineProperty`-shadowing litegraph's getter-only
 * `background_color`/`text_color` accessors (moot for a real DOM node,
 * which has plain, freely-settable `style` properties — see
 * `_armDeleteButtonColor()`) to `button.style.background`/`.color`, and
 * from `button.name = ...` (a canvas WIDGET's displayed text) to
 * `button.textContent = ...` (a DOM button's displayed text — `.name` on a
 * real `<button>` element is the unrelated HTML form-control name
 * attribute, invisible on screen; using it here would silently fail to show
 * anything, which is why this particular rename is not optional cosmetics).
 * `_actionButtons`/`_probeAndUpdateStatus()`'s disable loop is untouched and
 * works verbatim: a real `<button>`'s native `.disabled` is, if anything, a
 * more correct fit than the canvas widget's `.disabled` ever was (recall
 * the file header's own VERIFY(live) note below about `.disabled` blanking
 * a TEXT widget's value outright — moot for a button, which has no value to
 * blank either way).
 *
 * `target`/`name`/`status` (FORMAT.md §6.3: "[keep] the `name` text input
 * ... and the `target` control (place it sensibly — e.g. a small row above
 * the panes)") are untouched canvas widgets, declared before the DOM widget
 * in `_buildWidgets()` exactly as before — litegraph stacks widgets
 * top-to-bottom in declaration order, so they land above the two-pane panel
 * for free, with no new layout code needed. Composite capture/apply
 * (§4.1), selective Push (§6.2), `Show status`, and the v0.14.1
 * serialize-based capture are all in the "pure graph helpers" section far
 * below this class and in the `_do*`/`applySetTo*` methods — none of them
 * reference the `set` widget's TYPE or the removed menu functions at all,
 * so none of them needed to change for this redesign to be, per the task's
 * own framing, "a UI swap, not a behavior change."
 *
 * 2026-07-21b (owner feedback on the same-day two-pane build; FORMAT.md
 * §6.3 "Select vs. apply are SEPARATE clicks" + "Save State honors a
 * changed name" — both amended there the same day). Two behavior changes,
 * nothing else at the time — section (B) below was itself reversed the
 * very next day, 2026-07-22; see its own updated text, which keeps this
 * paragraph's original reasoning as history rather than deleting it:
 *
 * (A) SELECT vs APPLY split (owner: "We should now have it be a second
 * click to activate. Single click to select in case a user wants to update
 * a name or delete without changing all of the nodes."). A SINGLE click on
 * a list row now only SELECTS it — `_selectEntry()`: `_selectedSlug`, the
 * hidden serialized `set` widget + highlight repaint (both via
 * `_setSetValueSilently()`), and the `name` field loaded with the state's
 * own name (`entryDisplayName()` — the NAME, never the `.label`, whose
 * dedup "(slug)" suffix must not leak into the field and read as a rename)
 * — and provably cannot touch a loader: the select branch of
 * `_onSetPicked()` never reaches `_onSetSelected()`/`_doApply()`, and that
 * pair now has NO caller other than the apply branch. Applying is the
 * SECOND click — a click on the row that is ALREADY the current selection,
 * which is also exactly what the second click of a double-click is by the
 * time it lands. That branch keeps the old guarantee verbatim:
 * unconditional `_onSetSelected()` -> `_doApply()`, no same-value branch,
 * so re-applying the already-showing state still force-re-pushes strengths
 * (the 2026-07-19/19c fixes, unchanged). MECHANISM — ONE plain `click`
 * listener branching on "is this row the current selection?" (slug-
 * anchored via `_selectedSetEntry()`, the same label-drift-proof
 * resolution the delete confirm relies on), deliberately NOT a `dblclick`
 * listener: (1) a double-click's two presses arrive as two ordinary
 * `click` events — the first lands on a not-yet-selected row and selects,
 * the second lands on the now-selected row and applies — so double-click
 * works with zero double-click-specific code; (2) a `dblclick` listener ON
 * TOP of that would double-fire the apply (dblclick follows the second
 * click, which already applied); (3) FORMAT.md §6.3 spells the trigger as
 * "a double-click, or a click on the row that is already highlighted" —
 * the latter has no dblclick timing window at all (select now, apply
 * minutes later still applies; likewise the highlight RESTORED from a
 * saved workflow applies on its first click, by design). The mid-double-
 * click list rebuild is safe: click #1's re-render runs synchronously
 * inside its own handler (long before the second press can physically
 * land), and rebuilds the same rows in the same geometry (only classes
 * change — the active row's bold/border shifts no layout), so click #2's
 * mousedown+mouseup both land on the fresh row element carrying the same
 * listener and compose a normal `click` on it. Keyboard parity: Enter/
 * Space run the same two-step handler, and `_renderStateList()` now
 * restores focus (by row `data-slug`, `preventScroll: true`) onto the
 * rebuilt row — without that, the select-branch rebuild would drop focus
 * on the floor and a keyboard user could never deliver the second Enter;
 * it also stops the background sets-poll (`_applySetsResponse()` ->
 * `_renderStateList()`) from eating list focus mid-Tab. Any selection
 * MOVEMENT still disarms a pending delete-confirm (`_selectEntry()` keeps
 * `_onSetPicked()`'s old disarm and extends it to every selection write):
 * `_doDelete()` deletes whatever `_selectedSetEntry()` resolves at confirm
 * time, so a selection allowed to move under an armed button would aim the
 * confirm at the WRONG state. Restore round-trip is UNCHANGED: workflow
 * restore still writes the hidden widget via `configure()`'s plain
 * `.value =` (never a DOM click), so a reopened workflow shows its saved
 * selection highlighted without applying anything.
 *
 * (B) SAVE RENAMES IN PLACE — REVERSED 2026-07-22 (owner bug report, dated:
 * "selecting a state, changing the name of a state, and clicking save will
 * create a new entry" — filed as a BUG, a deliberate reversal one day
 * later of the 2026-07-21b decision this section used to document; see the
 * HISTORY paragraph below for that decision's own reasoning, kept rather
 * than deleted — this file's rename-history practice, same as the
 * NODE_TITLE renames at the very top of this header). Current behavior:
 * with a state SELECTED, Save State ALWAYS writes to THAT state's OWN
 * slug, never a new one. `_saveAsNewName()` (name kept from the
 * 2026-07-21b design though it now computes a RENAME target, not a
 * new-entry name — see its own doc comment) still decides once per Save,
 * up front in `_doUpdate()` (shared with `_updateComposite()`), whether
 * the trimmed `name` field is non-empty AND differs from the selected
 * entry's own name — but a non-null result no longer switches which POST
 * FORM this Save uses. EVERY Save now posts the SAME slug-form `POST
 * /lora_library/set` — `{ slug: entry.slug, set: {...} }` — whether or not
 * the name changed; a non-null result only changes what `set.name` carries
 * inside that one request. This needed ZERO backend changes:
 * `sets_store.save_set()`'s own docstring (lines 295-297) already states
 * the contract this relies on — "A caller-supplied slug (updating a known
 * set) is used as-is — renaming a set's display name must not move its
 * file out from under saved workflows/routes that reference it by slug" —
 * and it calls `normalize_set(set_data)` (line 299, which reads `name`
 * unconditionally from the posted `set` object) BEFORE it ever looks at
 * whether a slug was supplied (line 300's `if slug is None`).
 * routes_sets.py's `post_set` (lines 48-72) passes the body's `set`
 * straight through — `sets_store.save_set(context, body.get("set"),
 * slug=slug)` (line 67) — so a slug-form POST whose `set.name` differs
 * from the file's current name has ALWAYS been a rename-in-place at the
 * storage layer; this reversal only changes which POST FORM the
 * controller chooses to send. Rows are still the CURRENT capture either
 * way, and trigger_words/notes still come from a best-effort GET of the
 * selected state's own file — a rename now keeps its own metadata, same
 * as an overwrite always did (there is no "spin-off" left to inherit
 * anything from). `New State`/`_doCapture()` remains the ONLY create path,
 * untouched. EDGE CASES: renaming to a name that happens to equal some
 * OTHER state's display name is ALLOWED and never conflicts — `save_set`
 * only de-duplicates NAMES via `_unique_slug` for a brand-new, no-slug
 * save, never for an explicit-slug one, and the two-pane list's existing
 * dedup "(slug)"-suffix machinery (`_applySetsResponse()`) already
 * displays same-named entries unambiguously. Save with NO state selected
 * is unaffected — `_doUpdate()`'s existing early "no entry -> warn and
 * return" branch, above all of this, is untouched. The read-back toast's
 * lead verb is now `"Saved + renamed to"` for a rename — composing with
 * the read-back's own quoted, post-save name right after it into `Saved +
 * renamed to "New Name": ...` — or the pre-existing `"Updated"` otherwise;
 * an UNRENAMED Save is BYTE-IDENTICAL to every Save before this reversal,
 * toast included. Selection stays on the same slug afterward (it never
 * moved) and the `name` field is left holding the just-saved name rather
 * than cleared — both fall out of the existing `_selectSetBySlug()` ->
 * `_selectEntry()` chain running, exactly as before, AFTER
 * `_applySetsResponse()` has already refreshed `_setsCache` from the POST
 * response's own fresh `sets` list, so the entry `_selectEntry()` reads
 * back already carries the new name.
 *
 * HISTORY — the 2026-07-21b decision this reverses (owner then: "Save does
 * not save a new name if one of the elements is selected and the name has
 * changed. This is key for creating new items."): for exactly one day, a
 * changed `name` field made Save a SAVE-AS-NEW instead of an overwrite —
 * the SAME `POST /lora_library/set` route in its NO-SLUG form (the exact
 * create path `New State`/`_doCapture()` has always used; routes_sets.py
 * `post_set` derived the slug from the new name and `sets_store.
 * _unique_slug` de-duplicated it against existing files, so a new name
 * that happened to collide with some OTHER state's name minted a fresh
 * file rather than overwriting that state) — then selected the newly
 * created state and toasted with the create verb ("Saved"), read-back
 * included. Rows were the CURRENT capture either way (Save has always been
 * a re-capture); trigger_words/notes were inherited from the SELECTED
 * state (the same best-effort GET the overwrite path already did) — a
 * spun-off variant kept its parent's metadata rather than silently
 * blanking it; only the name and slug were new. This is EXACTLY the
 * mechanism the owner's 2026-07-22 report calls a bug ("will create a new
 * entry") — the two owner asks are a straight reversal of each other, not
 * a misunderstanding on either side, which is the whole reason this record
 * is kept rather than deleted. `New State` itself was, and remains,
 * unchanged, including its field-clearing epilogue:
 * `_doCapture()`/`_captureComposite()`'s explicit `name.value = ''`
 * deliberately runs AFTER `_selectSetBySlug()` (which loads the new
 * state's name into the field via `_selectEntry()`), so New State still
 * ends with an empty field — typing a name and pressing New State twice
 * still yields one named state plus one auto-named "State N", never two
 * same-named copies.
 *
 * This file binds to rgthree internals it does not own. Every binding is
 * cited below with the exact file + lines read (rgthree-comfy's COMPILED
 * `web/comfyui/power_lora_loader.js`, since that's what actually runs — not
 * the TS source), plus the ComfyUI_frontend litegraph fork that governs
 * widget/serialize mechanics. `VERIFY(live)` marks anything that could differ
 * on the version actually installed on Eric's rig — see the final report for
 * the consolidated risk list.
 *
 * Key rgthree bindings (rgthree-comfy/web/comfyui/power_lora_loader.js):
 *  - Node type string: `"Power Lora Loader (rgthree)"` — constants.js
 *    `addRgthree("Power Lora Loader")` (lines 2-4, 36).
 *  - Row widgets are named `lora_<n>` via `addNewLoraWidget()` (lines 85-94);
 *    `<n>` comes from a counter that only increments (never reuses numbers
 *    after a row is removed), so row names are NOT necessarily contiguous —
 *    we identify rows by name-pattern + value-shape, never by parsing/relying
 *    on the numeric suffix, and never by assuming a fixed count.
 *  - Row value shape: `{on, lora, strength, strengthTwo}` (DEFAULT_LORA_WIDGET_DATA,
 *    lines 352-357); the `value` setter (lines 386-395) does a plain
 *    `this._value = v` assignment — confirms whole-object assignment
 *    (`widget.value = {...}`) is safe and is in fact the exact pattern
 *    rgthree's own `configure()` uses when restoring rows from a workflow
 *    (lines 65-70: `const widget = this.addNewLoraWidget(); widget.value = {...widgetValue}`).
 *  - Single vs dual strength mode is a per-NODE property, not per-row:
 *    `node.properties["Show Strengths"]` (constants at lines 15-20; default
 *    set at line 28), consumed at draw time at line 405
 *    (`currentShowModelAndClip = node.properties[...] === "Separate Model & Clip"`).
 *  - Resize-after-mutate: rgthree's own "+ Add Lora" button handler (lines
 *    99-113) does `computeSize()` then `size[1] = Math.max(..., computed[1])`
 *    then `setDirtyCanvas(true, true)`. We follow the simpler `onNodeCreated`
 *    variant (lines 78-83, `Math.max(this.size[N], computed[N])`) rather than
 *    the `configure()`-only `_tempHeight` fallback (line 73), because
 *    `_tempHeight`/`_tempWidth` are only ever set inside `configure()` (line
 *    63-64) and may not exist on a node that was only ever built via manual
 *    "+ Add Lora" clicks.
 *  - Row removal: rgthree's own context-menu "🗑️ Remove" handler (lines
 *    201-206) calls `removeArrayItem(this.widgets, widget)`, a plain splice
 *    helper (rgthree-comfy/web/common/shared_utils.js:111-114 —
 *    `arr.splice(arr.indexOf(item), 1)`, no side effects). We do not import
 *    that internal helper (it is not a stable public surface for another
 *    node pack to depend on); instead we call the official LiteGraph
 *    `LGraphNode.prototype.removeWidget(widget)` API, which a genuine PLL
 *    instance always inherits. See VERIFY(live) note at applySetToTarget().
 *
 * Key ComfyUI_frontend litegraph bindings (src/lib/litegraph/src/):
 *  - `LGraphNode.removeWidget(widget)` (LGraphNode.ts:2037-2058) takes a
 *    WIDGET REFERENCE and throws `'Widget not found on this node'` if it
 *    can't find it via `indexOf` — it does NOT accept a numeric index,
 *    despite rgthree's OWN internal `configure()` calling `this.removeWidget(0)`
 *    in a loop (power_lora_loader.js:57-58). VERIFY(live): that suggests
 *    either version skew (an older/looser litegraph rgthree was built
 *    against) or that rgthree's own teardown loop is fragile on current
 *    frontends — not our problem to fix, but it means we must ALWAYS pass a
 *    real widget object, never an index, which is what we do.
 *  - Two distinct, similarly-named "serialize" flags (types/widgets.ts:62-66,
 *    434-441; confirmed by an explicit code comment in
 *    src/utils/executionUtil.ts:96-98): `widget.serialize` (top-level on the
 *    widget instance) controls inclusion in the saved workflow's
 *    `widgets_values` (LGraphNode.ts:986); `widget.options.serialize`
 *    controls inclusion in the API execution prompt only. rgthree's button
 *    pattern `addWidget("button", ..., {serialize:false})`
 *    (fast_actions_button.js:24) sets the LATTER, not the former — it does
 *    NOT keep a button out of `widgets_values` on this fork. We therefore set
 *    `widget.serialize = false` directly on the widget objects `addWidget`
 *    returns (see `_addButton`/status widget below). Moot for prompt
 *    inclusion either way since `isVirtualNode` nodes are stripped from the
 *    API prompt wholesale (executionUtil.ts:37-39, 86-91).
 *  - `label` vs `name` (2026-07-18c rename — fetched live from
 *    Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend `main` @ src/lib/litegraph/src/widgets/
 *    BaseWidget.ts on 2026-07-18; VERIFY(live) against whatever's actually
 *    installed on Eric's rig): `label` is a plain get/set pair backed by
 *    internal state (lines 91-96); `name` is set once from `addWidget()`'s
 *    2nd argument (line 169, `this.name = widget.name`) and never touched
 *    again by the base class. The rendered row text is
 *    `get displayName() { return this.label || this.name }` (lines 246-248),
 *    read by the shared label+value draw routine every combo/text/number
 *    widget goes through (`drawTruncatingText()`, lines 338-397 — line 348
 *    `const { displayName, _displayValue } = this`). So `.label` changes
 *    ONLY what's painted; `.name` is what `scanLoraRows()` pattern-matches
 *    in this file and what `widgetId()`/`setNodeId()` (lines 135-158) key
 *    off of, and per the save/restore-ordering note above this fork restores
 *    `widgets_values` by plain positional index, not by name — so nothing
 *    here needs `name === 'set'` for reload correctness, but our own
 *    lookups and any external workflow-scripting that greps a saved graph
 *    for a widget literally named `set` do. (2026-07-21: since the two-pane
 *    redesign hides this widget outright — `.hidden = true`, nothing paints
 *    it — `_buildWidgets()` no longer sets `.label` on it at all; `name:
 *    'set'` alone still carries every reload/lookup guarantee this bullet
 *    documents, unchanged.)
 *  - Per-widget custom colors (delete-button arm indicator, added for the
 *    2026-07-18c delete-bug fix, see `_armDeleteButtonColor()`; 2026-07-21:
 *    that function no longer uses this technique — the delete button is now
 *    a real DOM `<button>` with freely-settable `style` properties, so no
 *    getter-shadowing is needed there anymore. This bullet remains an
 *    accurate general LITEGRAPH BINDING for any canvas widget that still
 *    needs it — `status` below does not need colors, so nothing else in
 *    this file uses this technique post-redesign either):
 *    `background_color`/`text_color`/`outline_color` on `BaseWidget` are
 *    GETTER-ONLY accessors reading global theme constants (BaseWidget.ts:
 *    222-244, e.g. `get background_color() { return litegraph().WIDGET_BGCOLOR }`).
 *    The constructor even destructures and DISCARDS those exact key names
 *    off whatever's passed to `addWidget()` (lines 175-200, comment "Prevent
 *    naming conflicts with custom nodes") — passing them as widget options
 *    is a silent no-op by design, and a plain `widget.background_color = x`
 *    assignment would THROW if it ever reached the instance (getter-only
 *    accessor, strict-mode ES module semantics). `Object.defineProperty` is
 *    a different operation (`[[DefineOwnProperty]]`, not `[[Set]]`) and CAN
 *    still shadow an inherited accessor with an own one; `ButtonWidget`'s
 *    `drawWidget`/`drawLabel` (widgets/ButtonWidget.ts:24-59) read
 *    `this.background_color`/`this.text_color` at draw time, so an own
 *    accessor defined directly on one button instance is picked up on the
 *    very next repaint with no need to override `drawWidget` itself, and
 *    `delete`-ing that own property (`configurable: true`) restores the
 *    original theme getter exactly. VERIFY(live).
 *  - Save/restore ordering hazard (LGraphNode.ts:912-936 restore vs 982-994
 *    save): save writes `widgets_values[i]` at each widget's OWN index and
 *    leaves a hole where `serialize===false`; restore instead walks a
 *    SEPARATE counter that only advances past non-skipped widgets. These two
 *    only agree if every `serialize:false` widget sits AFTER every normally
 *    serialized widget — an interleaved layout would misread values on
 *    reload. This is why `target`/`set`/`name` are declared first and
 *    `status` + the two-pane DOM widget (both `serialize:false`) are
 *    declared last. Do not reorder without re-checking this. History: 4
 *    canvas buttons → 3 (2026-07-18 owner change removed the standalone
 *    Apply button, see `_onSetSelected`) → 4 (2026-07-19, Push State added,
 *    see `_doPush`) → 0 (2026-07-21: all 4 moved into the two-pane DOM
 *    widget's right pane as real `<button>` elements, see the file header's
 *    2026-07-21 section — they no longer participate in this ordering
 *    invariant at all; only `status` and the DOM widget itself still do).
 *  - `ComboWidget` supports `options.values` as a function
 *    (ComboWidget.ts:59-64, `getValues()`) — but it's deprecated as of
 *    v0.14.5 and logs a console warning on every dropdown open
 *    (ComboWidget.ts:126-135: "Using a function for values is deprecated.").
 *    It is still fully functional (this is the same pattern the deprecation
 *    message itself cites from ComfyUI-KJNodes), so we use it for `target`
 *    (cheap, pure in-memory graph scan — safe to re-run on every call).
 *    VERIFY(live): a future litegraph release could remove this path
 *    outright. (2026-07-21: `set` no longer uses this at all — it is a
 *    hidden plain `'text'` widget now, not a combo; the two-pane DOM
 *    widget's list reads `_setsCache` directly, with no `ComboWidget`/
 *    `getValues()` involved for state selection anymore.)
 *  - `LiteGraph`/`LGraphNode` are ambient globals in real, currently-shipping
 *    custom-node JS (not importable via any stable path from a node pack's
 *    own web dir) — confirmed by rgthree's OWN shipped code using them
 *    unimported: `LiteGraph.ContextMenu`/`LiteGraph.WIDGET_TEXT_COLOR` in
 *    power_lora_loader.js, `LiteGraph.NODE_WIDGET_HEIGHT` in bookmark.js:34,
 *    `LiteGraph.registerNodeType` in node_collector.js/base_node.js. Prior
 *    art for virtual-node registration itself: ComfyUI_frontend's
 *    `src/extensions/core/noteNode.ts` (`class X extends LGraphNode`,
 *    `this.isVirtualNode = true`, `LiteGraph.registerNodeType(name, X)`).
 *  - Combo callbacks do NOT fire during workflow restore. `configure()`
 *    restores `widgets_values` via a plain `widget.value = info.widgets_values[i++]`
 *    assignment (LGraphNode.ts:928-935). `ComboWidget`/`BaseSteppedWidget`
 *    (widgets/ComboWidget.ts, widgets/BaseSteppedWidget.ts) do not override
 *    `value`, so that assignment resolves to `BaseWidget`'s plain property
 *    setter (widgets/BaseWidget.ts:131-133: `this._state.value = value`) —
 *    NOT `setValue()` (BaseWidget.ts:416-436), the ONLY place `callback` is
 *    invoked (line 432). A saved workflow reopening can therefore never
 *    silently re-apply a set, no matter which mechanism drives the live
 *    pick. 2026-07-19c: since selection now goes through
 *    `_hookSetWidgetMenu()`'s `onClick` override (see the top-of-file
 *    2026-07-19c section) instead of the combo's `callback` option at all,
 *    this guarantee is now STRUCTURAL rather than belt-and-suspenders —
 *    restore literally cannot reach `_onSetPicked()`, so the old
 *    `_isRestoring`/`_silentSetWrite`/`configure()`-override guards (which
 *    existed only to stop a programmatic write from being mistaken for a
 *    callback-driven pick) were removed as dead code, not merely unused.
 *    `_setSetValueSilently()` survives as a plain, unguarded `.value =`
 *    helper — a display-only write, same as this bullet's finding always
 *    said it safely could be.
 *  - `widget.hidden` is a first-class, purpose-built hiding mechanism in
 *    this fork — NOT the same thing as the `.disabled` trick noted above
 *    for `status`. `LGraphNode.isWidgetVisible()` (LGraphNode.ts:3935-3939)
 *    and `getLayoutWidgets()` (3941-3947, "Filters out hidden widgets only
 *    ... for layout calculations") both branch on `.hidden`; `computeSize()`
 *    (line 1820) and `_arrangeWidgets()` (line 4166's `visibleWidgets`,
 *    consumed at 4206-4210 for both Y-position and total height) build
 *    exclusively off that filtered list. So `widget.hidden = true` removes
 *    a widget from drawing AND layout AND size — later widgets shift up,
 *    the node's natural height shrinks — a real hide, not a value-blank.
 *    `drawNode()` calls `node.arrange()` unconditionally every frame
 *    (LGraphCanvas.ts:5730), so toggling `.hidden` + `setDirtyCanvas(true,
 *    true)` is sufficient; no manual resize bookkeeping like
 *    `applySetToTarget()` needs for the (foreign, not-auto-arranging-for-
 *    our-purposes) PLL target. VERIFY(live) — DONE on Eric's rig
 *    (comfyui-test, port 8199): toggling the Properties Panel's "Show
 *    status" row live-flips `.hidden`, the row appears/disappears with no
 *    dead space, and the node redraws immediately — matches this reading
 *    exactly.
 *  - `LGraphNode.addProperty(name, default, type)` (LGraphNode.ts:1624-1638)
 *    pushes an `INodePropertyInfo` onto `properties_info` and seeds
 *    `this.properties[name]`. The right-click "Properties Panel" reads it
 *    back via `getPropertyInfo()` (1905-1934, matches by `name` in
 *    `properties_info`) and keys its editor widget off `info.type`
 *    (LGraphCanvas.ts ~8408-8416: `panel.addWidget(info.widget || info.type,
 *    pName, value, info, fUpdate)`) — passing `'boolean'` is what makes
 *    "Show status" a checkbox row rather than free text. `onPropertyChanged`
 *    fires from two places: user edits via `setProperty()` (LGraphNode.ts:
 *    1061-1081) and workflow restore via `configure()`'s OWN properties loop
 *    (842-850, `this.onPropertyChanged?.(k, info.properties[k])`) — the
 *    latter is exactly what we want here (a saved "Show status: true"
 *    should reveal the widget immediately on load), which is the opposite
 *    conclusion from the `set`-combo finding above; the two are unrelated
 *    code paths (property restore vs. widget-value restore) and both were
 *    read, not assumed.

       * holding a label string that no longer appears in the freshly
       * rebuilt cache, even though the armed entry itself still exists.
       * `_heartbeat()` only runs from `onDrawForeground()`, and an ACTIVE
       * QUEUE keeps the canvas dirty continuously (progress bar, executing-
       * node highlight), so its 1s throttle and the nested 4s
       * `SETS_POLL_MS` both fire like clockwork — and `SETS_POLL_MS` is the
       * SAME 4000ms as `DELETE_CONFIRM_MS`, so a sets-cache refresh is
       * near-guaranteed to land inside any given arm window while a queue is
       * busy, and often never fires at all across the same window while
       * idle. That is the concrete mechanism behind "worked when I tried it
       * standing still, failed mid-queue." When the label match failed, the

       * shown the same text persistently is hidden by default
       * (`PROP_SHOW_STATUS`) — so the button read as simply dead.

       * FIX: match by label first (cheap, correct the overwhelming majority
       * of the time, and what keeps a genuine NEW user pick working
       * immediately) but fall back to the last confidently-resolved SLUG —

       *
       *  - A click on a row that is NOT the current selection only SELECTS
       *    it (`_selectEntry()` — highlight, hidden `set` widget, `name`
       *    field, delete-confirm disarm) and provably cannot touch a
       *    loader: this branch never reaches `_onSetSelected()`, whose only
       *    caller is the branch below. Selecting to rename or delete no
       *    longer rewrites every wired PLL.
       *  - A click on the row that IS already the current selection — the
       *    second click of a double-click, or a plain later click on the
       *    highlighted row (including a highlight restored from a saved
       *    workflow) — is the APPLY, and keeps the pre-split guarantee

       *    same-value branch anywhere, so re-applying the already-showing
       *    state force-re-pushes strengths (2026-07-19/19c fixes).

       * "Is the current selection" is slug-anchored through
       * `_selectedSetEntry()` (label-drift-proof — the same resolution the
       * delete confirm relies on), and the apply branch still runs
       * `_selectEntry()` first (with `loadName: false`, so it can't clobber
       * a typed rename-in-progress name) — a dedup-suffix label drift self-heals
       * into the serialized widget instead of surviving until the next
       * save. `label` is always one of `_setsCache`'s own `.label` strings
