/**
 * @file Lora Loader State Controller — frontend-only virtual node
 * (FORMAT.md §6.3) that drives a genuine, untouched `Power Lora Loader
 * (rgthree)` node elsewhere in the graph. Registered purely in JS (like
 * core's MarkdownNote/NoteNode) — never executes, never appears in the API
 * prompt.
 *
 * Renamed from "LoRA Set Controller" (owner, 2026-07-18c): every user-facing
 * word now says "state" instead of "set" — button labels, the `set` widget's
 * on-canvas text, placeholders, toasts. The class id
 * `LoraLibrarySetController` and the backend `sets` storage/routes stay
 * FROZEN (FORMAT.md §6.3/§8) and keep saying "set" underneath — internal
 * identifiers (variables, methods, the widget's `name`, the
 * `lora_library:sets-changed` DOM event sets.js listens for) are
 * DELIBERATELY left alone so this stays a pure vocabulary change with zero
 * behavioral or serialization risk. See the `label` vs `name` bullet below
 * for the one widget where that distinction is load-bearing.
 *
 * Renamed AGAIN 2026-07-19 (owner: drop "Power" — "Power Lora Loader State
 * Controller" -> "Lora Loader State Controller"). Only `NODE_TITLE` changed:
 * the TARGET node this file drives is still genuinely titled "Power Lora
 * Loader (rgthree)", so every other "Power Lora Loader" string below
 * describes THAT node, not this one. Same owner report, two more fixes in
 * this same pass:
 *  (1) "Save State doesn't work; re-picking reverts to original strengths" —
 *      root-caused and fixed as two parts, LIVE-VERIFIED against the rig
 *      (comfyui-test, port 8199): see `_hookSetValueForReselect()` (a
 *      same-value re-pick in the `set` combo provably never reaches its
 *      callback on this fork — confirmed by reading the exact installed
 *      `BaseWidget.setValue` in comfyui-frontend-package 1.45.21) and
 *      `_doUpdate()`'s post-save re-apply. Capture itself was NOT at fault —
 *      `captureRows()` already reads the live, in-place-mutated
 *      `widget.value.strength`/`.strengthTwo` rgthree's real strength-drag
 *      handler writes (`power_lora_loader.js` `doOnStrengthAnyMove`/
 *      `stepStrength`), confirmed with an actual pointer drag on the rig.
 *  (2) Added the `Push State` button — broadcasts the selected state to
 *      every `LoraLibraryApplySet` node in the graph; see `_doPush()`.
 *
 * 2026-07-19c hardening (owner report AGAIN, this time on ComfyUI 0.28.1 —
 * "strengths are still not saved or updated"). (1) above shadowed
 * `BaseWidget.setValue` on the `set` widget INSTANCE. That shadow is correct
 * on THIS rig's exact frontend build (comfyui-frontend-package 1.45.21,
 * re-verified below, same file/lines as before) but is not a portable fix:
 * a different frontend build on the owner's 0.28.1 install can lay out
 * `ComboWidget`/`BaseWidget` differently enough that the shadow point
 * silently stops applying, and the regression looks IDENTICAL to the
 * original bug. Three changes replace it:
 *  (3) VERSION-PROOF SELECTION — `_hookSetValueForReselect()` is REMOVED.
 *      `_hookSetWidgetMenu()` / `_openSetMenu()` / `_onSetPicked()` replace
 *      it: the controller now owns the `set` widget's CLICK, not its VALUE
 *      SETTER. Re-verified against the same rig bundle cited above
 *      (static/assets/api-BqIxvqZ8.js):
 *        - `LGraphCanvas.processWidgetClick(e, node, widget)` (fired from
 *          widget hit-testing on pointer-down) resolves
 *          `c = toConcreteWidget(widget, node, false)` and only DEFERS the
 *          actual click: `pointer.onClick = () => c.onClick({e, node,
 *          canvas: this})`, invoked later by `CanvasPointer._completeClick`
 *          on pointer-up-without-drag.
 *        - `toConcreteWidget(e, node, promote)` starts with
 *          `if (e instanceof BaseWidget) return e`. `LGraphNode.addWidget()`
 *          itself already routes the raw `{type,name,value,...}` data
 *          through `toConcreteWidget` inside `addCustomWidget()` and
 *          pushes/returns THAT result (a real `ComboWidget` instance), never
 *          the raw data — so the object `this.addWidget('combo', ...)` hands
 *          back to us IS ALREADY that instance, and `c === widget` above,
 *          every time, with no proxy or fresh wrapper in between. Shadowing
 *          `.onClick` as an own property on that exact instance is therefore
 *          a stable, version-proof override: unlike `setValue`, there is no
 *          second internal (a `callback` option, a same-value branch) for a
 *          future frontend build to reintroduce this same failure through.
 *        - Stock `ComboWidget.onClick` — the method being replaced — is
 *          itself nothing more than `new LiteGraph.ContextMenu(values, {
 *          scale, event, className:'dark', callback: v => this.setValue(v,
 *          {e,node,canvas}) })`. `_openSetMenu()` below is that exact
 *          mechanism with the `setValue` detour removed, not a foreign
 *          technique bolted on. Further precedent for a node pack calling
 *          `LiteGraph.ContextMenu` directly: rgthree's OWN lora-row
 *          right-click menu (power_lora_loader.js
 *          `RgthreePowerLoraLoader.getSlotMenuOptions`, `new
 *          LiteGraph.ContextMenu(menuItems, {title, event})`).
 *        - `ContextMenu`'s per-item click (its `inner_onclick`) invokes
 *          `options.callback.call(itemEl, pickedValue, options, domEvent,
 *          menuInstance)` — `pickedValue` is exactly the array element we
 *          passed in, the identical shape the stock widget's own callback
 *          above receives — so `_openSetMenu()`'s callback getting the
 *          picked LABEL string as its one argument is guaranteed by the same
 *          code path the stock widget relies on, not an assumption.
 *      Net effect: EVERY menu pick — including re-picking the state already
 *      showing — runs `_onSetPicked()` unconditionally. There is no
 *      same-value branch anywhere in this path to route around, because
 *      `BaseWidget.setValue` (the only place that branch lives) is never
 *      called for a user pick anymore. The `_isRestoring`/`_silentSetWrite`
 *      guard fields and the `configure()` override that bracketed them are
 *      REMOVED as a consequence, not merely left unused: they existed only
 *      to stop a programmatic `.value =` write from being mistaken for a
 *      real pick THROUGH THE OLD CALLBACK/setValue path. With that path
 *      gone, a plain assignment structurally cannot reach `_onSetPicked()`
 *      — see the "Combo callbacks do NOT fire during workflow restore"
 *      bullet below, updated to match.
 *  (4) READ-BACK TOAST — `_toastRowsSaved()`. `New State`/`Save State` now
 *      follow their write with a real `GET /lora_library/set?slug=`
 *      (FORMAT.md §5) and toast what the FILE holds, not what the button
 *      THINKS it sent — a wrong `captureRows()` read on a different rgthree
 *      build, or any backend-side transform, shows up in the toast text
 *      itself. `captureRows()`'s per-field fallback chain was also widened
 *      (still read-only, still never writes an alias back). `Show status`
 *      (still hidden by default) additionally names the capture-source
 *      loader id + row count on every capture/save — see `_setStatusText()`.
 *  (5) SELECTIVE PUSH — FORMAT.md §6.2's `mirrors loader` tag, written by
 *      the sibling `sets.js` on every `LoraLibraryApplySet` node. `_doPush()`
 *      now reads the controller's OWN `target` combo to decide WHICH Apply
 *      nodes to touch: a specific Power Lora Loader target restricts the
 *      push to Apply nodes tagged to that same node (plus any tagged
 *      "(any)"); `All…` pushes to every Apply node regardless of tag. See
 *      `selectPushTargets()`/`mirrorsTagMatches()`. Deliberately still
 *      independent of `probeTargets()` (rgthree health) — a push never
 *      touches rgthree, so it keeps working with rgthree uninstalled or the
 *      target unhealthy, exactly as before this amendment.
 *
 * This file binds to rgthree internals it does not own. Every binding is
 * cited below with the exact file + lines read (rgthree-comfy's COMPILED
 * `web/comfyui/power_lora_loader.js`, since that's what actually runs — not
 * the TS source), plus the ComfyUI_frontend litegraph fork that governs
 * widget/serialize mechanics. `VERIFY(live)` marks anything that could differ
 * on the version actually installed on Eric's rig — see the final report for
 * the consolidated risk list.
 *
 * Key rgthree bindings (rgthree-comfy/web/comfyui/power_lora_loader.js):
 *  - Node type string: `"Power Lora Loader (rgthree)"` — constants.js
 *    `addRgthree("Power Lora Loader")` (lines 2-4, 36).
 *  - Row widgets are named `lora_<n>` via `addNewLoraWidget()` (lines 85-94);
 *    `<n>` comes from a counter that only increments (never reuses numbers
 *    after a row is removed), so row names are NOT necessarily contiguous —
 *    we identify rows by name-pattern + value-shape, never by parsing/relying
 *    on the numeric suffix, and never by assuming a fixed count.
 *  - Row value shape: `{on, lora, strength, strengthTwo}` (DEFAULT_LORA_WIDGET_DATA,
 *    lines 352-357); the `value` setter (lines 386-395) does a plain
 *    `this._value = v` assignment — confirms whole-object assignment
 *    (`widget.value = {...}`) is safe and is in fact the exact pattern
 *    rgthree's own `configure()` uses when restoring rows from a workflow
 *    (lines 65-70: `const widget = this.addNewLoraWidget(); widget.value = {...widgetValue}`).
 *  - Single vs dual strength mode is a per-NODE property, not per-row:
 *    `node.properties["Show Strengths"]` (constants at lines 15-20; default
 *    set at line 28), consumed at draw time at line 405
 *    (`currentShowModelAndClip = node.properties[...] === "Separate Model & Clip"`).
 *  - Resize-after-mutate: rgthree's own "+ Add Lora" button handler (lines
 *    99-113) does `computeSize()` then `size[1] = Math.max(..., computed[1])`
 *    then `setDirtyCanvas(true, true)`. We follow the simpler `onNodeCreated`
 *    variant (lines 78-83, `Math.max(this.size[N], computed[N])`) rather than
 *    the `configure()`-only `_tempHeight` fallback (line 73), because
 *    `_tempHeight`/`_tempWidth` are only ever set inside `configure()` (line
 *    63-64) and may not exist on a node that was only ever built via manual
 *    "+ Add Lora" clicks.
 *  - Row removal: rgthree's own context-menu "🗑️ Remove" handler (lines
 *    201-206) calls `removeArrayItem(this.widgets, widget)`, a plain splice
 *    helper (rgthree-comfy/web/common/shared_utils.js:111-114 —
 *    `arr.splice(arr.indexOf(item), 1)`, no side effects). We do not import
 *    that internal helper (it is not a stable public surface for another
 *    node pack to depend on); instead we call the official LiteGraph
 *    `LGraphNode.prototype.removeWidget(widget)` API, which a genuine PLL
 *    instance always inherits. See VERIFY(live) note at applySetToTarget().
 *
 * Key ComfyUI_frontend litegraph bindings (src/lib/litegraph/src/):
 *  - `LGraphNode.removeWidget(widget)` (LGraphNode.ts:2037-2058) takes a
 *    WIDGET REFERENCE and throws `'Widget not found on this node'` if it
 *    can't find it via `indexOf` — it does NOT accept a numeric index,
 *    despite rgthree's OWN internal `configure()` calling `this.removeWidget(0)`
 *    in a loop (power_lora_loader.js:57-58). VERIFY(live): that suggests
 *    either version skew (an older/looser litegraph rgthree was built
 *    against) or that rgthree's own teardown loop is fragile on current
 *    frontends — not our problem to fix, but it means we must ALWAYS pass a
 *    real widget object, never an index, which is what we do.
 *  - Two distinct, similarly-named "serialize" flags (types/widgets.ts:62-66,
 *    434-441; confirmed by an explicit code comment in
 *    src/utils/executionUtil.ts:96-98): `widget.serialize` (top-level on the
 *    widget instance) controls inclusion in the saved workflow's
 *    `widgets_values` (LGraphNode.ts:986); `widget.options.serialize`
 *    controls inclusion in the API execution prompt only. rgthree's button
 *    pattern `addWidget("button", ..., {serialize:false})`
 *    (fast_actions_button.js:24) sets the LATTER, not the former — it does
 *    NOT keep a button out of `widgets_values` on this fork. We therefore set
 *    `widget.serialize = false` directly on the widget objects `addWidget`
 *    returns (see `_addButton`/status widget below). Moot for prompt
 *    inclusion either way since `isVirtualNode` nodes are stripped from the
 *    API prompt wholesale (executionUtil.ts:37-39, 86-91).
 *  - `label` vs `name` (2026-07-18c rename — fetched live from
 *    Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend `main` @ src/lib/litegraph/src/widgets/
 *    BaseWidget.ts on 2026-07-18; VERIFY(live) against whatever's actually
 *    installed on Eric's rig): `label` is a plain get/set pair backed by
 *    internal state (lines 91-96); `name` is set once from `addWidget()`'s
 *    2nd argument (line 169, `this.name = widget.name`) and never touched
 *    again by the base class. The rendered row text is
 *    `get displayName() { return this.label || this.name }` (lines 246-248),
 *    read by the shared label+value draw routine every combo/text/number
 *    widget goes through (`drawTruncatingText()`, lines 338-397 — line 348
 *    `const { displayName, _displayValue } = this`). So `.label` changes
 *    ONLY what's painted; `.name` is what `scanLoraRows()` pattern-matches
 *    in this file and what `widgetId()`/`setNodeId()` (lines 135-158) key
 *    off of, and per the save/restore-ordering note above this fork restores
 *    `widgets_values` by plain positional index, not by name — so nothing
 *    here needs `name === 'set'` for reload correctness, but our own
 *    lookups and any external workflow-scripting that greps a saved graph
 *    for a widget literally named `set` do. `_buildWidgets()` therefore sets
 *    `this._w.set.label = 'state'` right after creating the widget and
 *    leaves `name: 'set'` alone.
 *  - Per-widget custom colors (delete-button arm indicator, added for the
 *    2026-07-18c delete-bug fix, see `_armDeleteButtonColor()`):
 *    `background_color`/`text_color`/`outline_color` on `BaseWidget` are
 *    GETTER-ONLY accessors reading global theme constants (BaseWidget.ts:
 *    222-244, e.g. `get background_color() { return litegraph().WIDGET_BGCOLOR }`).
 *    The constructor even destructures and DISCARDS those exact key names
 *    off whatever's passed to `addWidget()` (lines 175-200, comment "Prevent
 *    naming conflicts with custom nodes") — passing them as widget options
 *    is a silent no-op by design, and a plain `widget.background_color = x`
 *    assignment would THROW if it ever reached the instance (getter-only
 *    accessor, strict-mode ES module semantics). `Object.defineProperty` is
 *    a different operation (`[[DefineOwnProperty]]`, not `[[Set]]`) and CAN
 *    still shadow an inherited accessor with an own one; `ButtonWidget`'s
 *    `drawWidget`/`drawLabel` (widgets/ButtonWidget.ts:24-59) read
 *    `this.background_color`/`this.text_color` at draw time, so an own
 *    accessor defined directly on one button instance is picked up on the
 *    very next repaint with no need to override `drawWidget` itself, and
 *    `delete`-ing that own property (`configurable: true`) restores the
 *    original theme getter exactly. VERIFY(live).
 *  - Save/restore ordering hazard (LGraphNode.ts:912-936 restore vs 982-994
 *    save): save writes `widgets_values[i]` at each widget's OWN index and
 *    leaves a hole where `serialize===false`; restore instead walks a
 *    SEPARATE counter that only advances past non-skipped widgets. These two
 *    only agree if every `serialize:false` widget sits AFTER every normally
 *    serialized widget — an interleaved layout would misread values on
 *    reload. This is why `target`/`set`/`name` are declared first and
 *    `status` + all 4 buttons (all `serialize:false`) are declared last.
 *    Do not reorder without re-checking this. Button count history: 4 → 3
 *    when the 2026-07-18 owner change removed the standalone Apply button
 *    (see `_onSetSelected`) → 4 again on 2026-07-19 with Push State added
 *    (see `_doPush`).
 *  - `ComboWidget` supports `options.values` as a function
 *    (ComboWidget.ts:59-64, `getValues()`) — but it's deprecated as of
 *    v0.14.5 and logs a console warning on every dropdown open
 *    (ComboWidget.ts:126-135: "Using a function for values is deprecated.").
 *    It is still fully functional (this is the same pattern the deprecation
 *    message itself cites from ComfyUI-KJNodes), so we use it for `target`
 *    (cheap, pure in-memory graph scan — safe to re-run on every call) and
 *    for `set` (backed by a manually-refreshed cache, never a network call
 *    from inside the values function itself). VERIFY(live): a future
 *    litegraph release could remove this path outright.
 *  - `LiteGraph`/`LGraphNode` are ambient globals in real, currently-shipping
 *    custom-node JS (not importable via any stable path from a node pack's
 *    own web dir) — confirmed by rgthree's OWN shipped code using them
 *    unimported: `LiteGraph.ContextMenu`/`LiteGraph.WIDGET_TEXT_COLOR` in
 *    power_lora_loader.js, `LiteGraph.NODE_WIDGET_HEIGHT` in bookmark.js:34,
 *    `LiteGraph.registerNodeType` in node_collector.js/base_node.js. Prior
 *    art for virtual-node registration itself: ComfyUI_frontend's
 *    `src/extensions/core/noteNode.ts` (`class X extends LGraphNode`,
 *    `this.isVirtualNode = true`, `LiteGraph.registerNodeType(name, X)`).
 *  - Combo callbacks do NOT fire during workflow restore. `configure()`
 *    restores `widgets_values` via a plain `widget.value = info.widgets_values[i++]`
 *    assignment (LGraphNode.ts:928-935). `ComboWidget`/`BaseSteppedWidget`
 *    (widgets/ComboWidget.ts, widgets/BaseSteppedWidget.ts) do not override
 *    `value`, so that assignment resolves to `BaseWidget`'s plain property
 *    setter (widgets/BaseWidget.ts:131-133: `this._state.value = value`) —
 *    NOT `setValue()` (BaseWidget.ts:416-436), the ONLY place `callback` is
 *    invoked (line 432). A saved workflow reopening can therefore never
 *    silently re-apply a set, no matter which mechanism drives the live
 *    pick. 2026-07-19c: since selection now goes through
 *    `_hookSetWidgetMenu()`'s `onClick` override (see the top-of-file
 *    2026-07-19c section) instead of the combo's `callback` option at all,
 *    this guarantee is now STRUCTURAL rather than belt-and-suspenders —
 *    restore literally cannot reach `_onSetPicked()`, so the old
 *    `_isRestoring`/`_silentSetWrite`/`configure()`-override guards (which
 *    existed only to stop a programmatic write from being mistaken for a
 *    callback-driven pick) were removed as dead code, not merely unused.
 *    `_setSetValueSilently()` survives as a plain, unguarded `.value =`
 *    helper — a display-only write, same as this bullet's finding always
 *    said it safely could be.
 *  - `widget.hidden` is a first-class, purpose-built hiding mechanism in
 *    this fork — NOT the same thing as the `.disabled` trick noted above
 *    for `status`. `LGraphNode.isWidgetVisible()` (LGraphNode.ts:3935-3939)
 *    and `getLayoutWidgets()` (3941-3947, "Filters out hidden widgets only
 *    ... for layout calculations") both branch on `.hidden`; `computeSize()`
 *    (line 1820) and `_arrangeWidgets()` (line 4166's `visibleWidgets`,
 *    consumed at 4206-4210 for both Y-position and total height) build
 *    exclusively off that filtered list. So `widget.hidden = true` removes
 *    a widget from drawing AND layout AND size — later widgets shift up,
 *    the node's natural height shrinks — a real hide, not a value-blank.
 *    `drawNode()` calls `node.arrange()` unconditionally every frame
 *    (LGraphCanvas.ts:5730), so toggling `.hidden` + `setDirtyCanvas(true,
 *    true)` is sufficient; no manual resize bookkeeping like
 *    `applySetToTarget()` needs for the (foreign, not-auto-arranging-for-
 *    our-purposes) PLL target. VERIFY(live) — DONE on Eric's rig
 *    (comfyui-test, port 8199): toggling the Properties Panel's "Show
 *    status" row live-flips `.hidden`, the row appears/disappears with no
 *    dead space, and the node redraws immediately — matches this reading
 *    exactly.
 *  - `LGraphNode.addProperty(name, default, type)` (LGraphNode.ts:1624-1638)
 *    pushes an `INodePropertyInfo` onto `properties_info` and seeds
 *    `this.properties[name]`. The right-click "Properties Panel" reads it
 *    back via `getPropertyInfo()` (1905-1934, matches by `name` in
 *    `properties_info`) and keys its editor widget off `info.type`
 *    (LGraphCanvas.ts ~8408-8416: `panel.addWidget(info.widget || info.type,
 *    pName, value, info, fUpdate)`) — passing `'boolean'` is what makes
 *    "Show status" a checkbox row rather than free text. `onPropertyChanged`
 *    fires from two places: user edits via `setProperty()` (LGraphNode.ts:
 *    1061-1081) and workflow restore via `configure()`'s OWN properties loop
 *    (842-850, `this.onPropertyChanged?.(k, info.properties[k])`) — the
 *    latter is exactly what we want here (a saved "Show status: true"
 *    should reveal the widget immediately on load), which is the opposite
 *    conclusion from the `set`-combo finding above; the two are unrelated
 *    code paths (property restore vs. widget-value restore) and both were
 *    read, not assumed.

       * rebuilt from scratch on every `_refreshSetsCache()` poll, and this
       * method used to match ONLY by that label against the current
       * `_setsCache`. The backend's `list_sets()` sort is fully
       * deterministic for unchanged data (lora_library/sets_store.py:242,
       * `sort(key=lambda e: (e["name"].casefold(), e["slug"]))` — slug is
       * unique so there's never a real tie), so a bare, no-op poll never by
       * itself reshuffles labels. But ANY actual library change during the
       * ~4s arm-to-confirm window — renaming/capturing/deleting ANY state,
       * even one unrelated to the one armed, since that can add or remove a
       * DIFFERENT entry's "(slug)" dedup suffix — can leave the widget still
       * holding a label string that no longer appears in the freshly
       * rebuilt cache, even though the armed entry itself still exists.
       * `_heartbeat()` only runs from `onDrawForeground()`, and an ACTIVE
       * QUEUE keeps the canvas dirty continuously (progress bar, executing-
       * node highlight), so its 1s throttle and the nested 4s
       * `SETS_POLL_MS` both fire like clockwork — and `SETS_POLL_MS` is the
       * SAME 4000ms as `DELETE_CONFIRM_MS`, so a sets-cache refresh is
       * near-guaranteed to land inside any given arm window while a queue is
       * busy, and often never fires at all across the same window while
       * idle. That is the concrete mechanism behind "worked when I tried it
       * standing still, failed mid-queue." When the label match failed, the
       * second click fell through to `_doDelete()`'s `if (!entry)` branch,
       * which only shows a WARN toast ("Pick a saved state first.") — easy
       * to miss on a busy screen, and the `status` widget that would have
       * shown the same text persistently is hidden by default
       * (`PROP_SHOW_STATUS`) — so the button read as simply dead.
       *
       * FIX: match by label first (cheap, correct the overwhelming majority
       * of the time, and what keeps a genuine NEW user pick working
       * immediately) but fall back to the last confidently-resolved SLUG —
       * stable for the entry's whole lifetime, FORMAT.md §4 — instead of
       * reporting "nothing selected." `_onDeleteClick()` also calls this at
       * ARM time specifically so `_selectedSlug` is fresh for the whole
