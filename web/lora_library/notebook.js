/**
 * @file Prompt Notebook two-pane DOM widget (FORMAT.md §7.2) — attaches to
 * `LoraLibraryNotebook` nodes. Left pane: a scrollable, category-grouped,
 * multi-selectable, drag-to-reorder (including a multiselect dragged as one
 * block, and a whole category dragged by its header) entry list — with
 * CLICKABLE, COLLAPSIBLE category headers (single tap toggles collapse AND
 * selects; incl. empty categories — see "Categories" below) and a ＋ New
 * control that creates either an entry (landing directly below the active
 * one — "New-below" below) or (given a `#`-prefixed name) a category, plus
 * 🗑 Delete (entry-only). Right pane: a NAME field (the primary rename
 * control — see "Rename via the editor's name field" below) above a
 * `<textarea>` editor, a Save button, and a status line (conflict
 * resolution per §3.5 lands there too) — both fields are CONTEXTUAL, entry
 * body/name or category description/name, per whichever was last clicked,
 * with a mode hint saying which. Above both panes, a file panel — now the
 * ONLY visible file control, full-width — shows the notebook's RESOLVED
 * absolute path plus Browse…/Open folder buttons; the raw `file` STRING
 * widget itself is hidden outright (`.hidden`, not merely read-only) since
 * this panel replaces it, and both panel buttons hide (and the panel
 * becomes read-only in effect) for a remote (`is_local: false`) viewer, whose
 * host-machine notice lives on its own line, never inline. The node's own
 * `file`/`entry` STRING widgets stay the serialized truth (§6.1/§7.2) — this
 * DOM widget only ever *reads* `file` and *writes* `entry`/`file` through
 * their normal widget setters; it never serializes itself, and neither does
 * the left list's collapse state (session/per-node UI only — see "Single-tap
 * collapse" below).
 *
 * Multi-select (FORMAT.md §6.1/§7.2, owner amendment 2026-07-18): ctrl/
 * cmd+click toggles one entry in/out of the selection, shift+click extends
 * the visible range from the ACTIVE entry (the most recently clicked one),
 * and a plain click collapses to a single selection. `entry` serializes the
 * whole selection as one name per line, in selection order (§6.1) — the
 * ACTIVE entry alone drives the editor pane, dirty tracking, Save, Delete,
 * and conflict handling, exactly like the single-select behavior this file
 * always had. See the "Selection model" section below the state helpers.
 *
 * Drag-to-reorder (FORMAT.md §3.4/§5/§7.2, owner amendment 2026-07-18):
 * pointer-based row dragging (deliberately not HTML5 drag-and-drop — see the
 * pointer-events bullet below) with an insertion-line marker, committed as
 * one `POST /lora_library/notebook/move`. See the "Drag-to-reorder" section
 * below the selection helpers.
 *
 * Frontend APIs relied on here (verified against a `Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend`
 * checkout — see the notebook-frontend handoff notes for exact file:line
 * references):
 *  - `LGraphNode.prototype.addDOMWidget(name, type, element, options)` —
 *    present for both the legacy canvas renderer and the Vue-node renderer
 *    (`scripts/domWidget.ts`), which is why it is used instead of any
 *    renderer-specific API.
 *  - `options.getMinHeight` and the *absence* of `options.getMaxHeight` —
 *    litegraph's widget-arrange pass (`LGraphNode._arrangeWidgets`) gives
 *    DOM widgets whatever vertical space is left after fixed-height widgets
 *    (`file`, `entry`) via `distributeSpace()`; an unset max means "take all
 *    remaining space", which is exactly "the widget fills available height".
 *  - `node.comfyClass` — ComfyUI's node-registration step
 *    (`services/litegraphService.ts`) sets `comfyClass` on *both* the node
 *    class's `.prototype` and the class itself, specifically so extensions
 *    can feature-detect a node's Python class id from `nodeCreated`; this is
 *    the same mechanism core extensions (e.g. `extensions/core/load3d.ts`)
 *    use.
 *  - Excluding a DOM widget from serialization has two independent knobs:
 *    `widget.serialize = false` (workflow JSON — checked by
 *    `LGraphNode.serialize`/`.configure`) and `widget.options.serialize =
 *    false` / `widget.serializeValue = () => undefined` (the API prompt sent
 *    for execution — checked by `utils/executionUtil.ts`). All three are set
 *    below so the widget never serializes under either mechanism, matching
 *    core's own idiom (e.g. `extensions/core/webcamCapture.ts`:
 *    `btn.serializeValue = () => undefined`).
 *  - Pointer events over a DOM widget are NOT swallowed by the litegraph
 *    canvas underneath it, which is why drag-to-reorder below uses plain
 *    pointerdown/move/up instead of HTML5 DnD (owner's ask, since native DnD
 *    is known to fight canvas-level handlers):
 *    `src/components/graph/GraphCanvas.vue` mounts `<canvas
 *    id="graph-canvas">` (line 58) and `<DomWidgets>` (line 113) as DOM
 *    SIBLINGS in the same template, never nested. A pointerdown that targets
 *    our widget's elements therefore never passes through the `<canvas>`
 *    element at all, so litegraph's own capture-phase handler
 *    (`LGraphCanvas.ts:2026`: `canvas.addEventListener('pointerdown',
 *    this._mousedown_callback, true)`) structurally cannot see it — capture
 *    phase only intercepts events whose target is a descendant of the
 *    listener's element, and a DOM sibling is not a descendant. On top of
 *    that, `src/components/graph/widgets/DomWidget.vue` (lines 109-113)
 *    inline-styles `pointerEvents: 'auto'` on the widget wrapper whenever it
 *    is visible, not read-only, and not disabled (the normal editing state)
 *    — that's what makes the browser hit-test to our DOM content instead of
 *    falling through to the canvas visually underneath it. (The only other
 *    capture-phase `document`-level pointerdown listener found,
 *    `useNodeDragToCanvas.ts:125`, only activates mid "drag a new node from
 *    the library onto the canvas" and no-ops otherwise, so it doesn't
 *    interfere either.) This file's pre-existing pane-splitter drag
 *    (`wireSplitter`, unchanged below) already exercised this exact
 *    pointer-event path live before today's change — drag-to-reorder reuses
 *    the identical technique.
 *
 * Multi-delete (FORMAT.md §7.2 amendment, owner 2026-07-18c): Delete now
 * removes EVERY selected entry, not just the active one. The confirm label
 * shows the count when >1 ("Are you sure? (3)"); deletion is sequential
 * over the existing single-entry §5 delete route (one request per name, in
 * selection order), refreshing `base_mtime` from each response so later
 * requests in the same run check against the file's latest state. A
 * mid-run 409 stops the run and surfaces the same Reload/Overwrite
 * conflict UI Save/Move already use; Overwrite resumes the run from the
 * failed name with that one request forced (base_mtime omitted), then
 * continues normally. See performDeleteRun() below.
 *
 * Rename via the editor's name field (FORMAT.md §7.2 amendment, owner ask
 * 2026-07-19 — supersedes the double-click-inline-input scheme this
 * paragraph used to describe, removed outright, "the old inline rename was
 * reported not working"): a NAME field sits at the top of the right pane,
 * above the mode hint (buildUi()'s `state.nameFieldEl`). It always shows
 * the currently-active item's name (entry or category — populateEditor()
 * sets it alongside the textarea, so the two never drift apart) and is
 * plain-editable text; editing it dirties the SAME Save button the
 * textarea does (refreshDirty() ORs both), and Save (performSave()/
 * performSaveCategory()) sends the field's value as `rename_to` in the
 * very same request as the body/description write WHEN it differs from
 * the active name — one request does both, atomically, whenever both
 * changed. Duplicate names are refused client-side first (checked against
 * `state.entries`/`state.categories`), server authoritative same as every
 * other write in this file. Double-clicking a row no longer opens an
 * inline editor — it just moves focus (+select()) to this field via
 * focusNameField(), relying on the SAME click-vs-drag-vs-double-click
 * disambiguation already documented for onEntryPointerDown below (both
 * single-clicks that precede a dblclick resolve to a selection change
 * first, which is what makes the name field already show the right item's
 * name by the time focus lands on it — modulo the harmless brief race
 * described at focusNameField()'s own definition).
 *
 * File panel (FORMAT.md §7.2 amendment, reworked 2026-07-19 — "why trim at
 * all, make it full width; what's the point of the file field at top,
 * replace it with this"): the raw `file` STRING widget is hidden outright
 * via `widget.hidden = true` (hideFileWidget(), called once at attach) —
 * the same first-class litegraph layout primitive controller.js's "Show
 * status" toggle uses (see that file's header for the citations backing
 * this: `.hidden` pulls a widget out of drawing AND layout AND size, unlike
 * `.disabled`, which on this fork blanks a disabled TEXT widget's value
 * outright instead of graying it out — wrong for a widget that must keep
 * serializing the node's real value). This panel — a muted bar between the
 * node's own widgets and the two panes — is what replaces it as the visible
 * file control: a full-width row shows the notebook's RESOLVED absolute
 * path (the `file` field of every `GET /notebook` response — NOT the
 * `file` WIDGET's possibly-relative value) plus `Browse…`/`Open folder`;
 * updateFilePanelPath() sets the FULL path first and only front-truncates
 * (`frontTruncate()`, unchanged — keeps the tail, usually the filename,
 * visible instead of the head) once a real DOM overflow check
 * (`scrollWidth > clientWidth`) says it genuinely doesn't fit at the bar's
 * CURRENT width, re-checked on resize via a `ResizeObserver` — never at a
 * fixed character budget regardless of the node's actual size. The full
 * path always sits in `title`. `Browse…` opens a small modal file picker
 * (attached to `document.body`, not nested inside this widget's own root —
 * see openBrowsePicker()'s doc comment for why) walking `GET /fs/list`;
 * `Open folder` fires `POST /notebook/open_folder` and reports failure on
 * the status line.
 *
 * Remote gating: `GET /config`'s `is_local` (fetched once per attach,
 * cached at MODULE scope with a short TTL so N attached nodes share one
 * fetch) hides both file-panel buttons and makes the panel's path
 * effectively read-only for a remote (non-loopback) viewer — the panel is
 * a `<div>`, not an input, so "read-only" here just means there's no
 * control left that could change `file`. The host-machine notice
 * ("the host controls which file this node reads") lives on its OWN line
 * below the path/buttons row (`state.filePanelNoteEl`, its own block, not
 * squeezed inline the way it used to be) and is populated ONLY when
 * `is_local === false` — the element is empty (and `:empty { display:
 * none }` collapses it to zero height) on every local load, never shown
 * "just in case." The `file` widget's callback (already wrapped by
 * wireFileWidget below) additionally reverts any programmatic edit back to
 * the last known-good value for a remote viewer and posts that same calm
 * status note — belt-and-suspenders now that hideFileWidget() means no UI
 * surface should be able to trigger that edit at all. Every other feature
 * in this file (browsing/editing/saving/deleting/renaming/reordering
 * entries) stays fully functional for a remote viewer — only the FILE the
 * node points at is host-controlled.
 *
 * New-below (owner ask 2026-07-19 "New makes an entry right below the
 * selected one"): confirmNewEntry() passes `after: state.activeName` to
 * `POST /notebook/entry` whenever an ENTRY is active (category mode off);
 * with nothing active, or a CATEGORY active, it keeps the old end-of-file/
 * end-of-category append (the server falls back to that same append on an
 * omitted/unresolvable `after` regardless, so this is a request-shaping
 * choice, not a safety one).
 *
 * Browse picker drive/UNC + path input (FORMAT.md §5 fix, owner's NAS
 * case): the picker's `..` row already forwards whatever `parent` the
 * server reports, which — since routes.py's `fs/list` now reports
 * `parent: "ROOTS"` at a Windows drive root and `parent: null` only at an
 * actual top (no sibling to climb to, e.g. a UNC share root or POSIX `/`)
 * — already climbs correctly and already hides itself at a true top; the
 * one real bug fixed here is navigating a drive-list ENTRY (`C:\`, listed
 * when `dir` is the `FS_ROOTS` sentinel): that name is already a complete
 * root, so it must be opened AS-IS, never joined onto the literal `"ROOTS"`
 * string like a normal child (joinServerPath() would produce the nonsense
 * path `"ROOTS/C:\"` — see renderPickerDialog()). A "type or paste a path"
 * input pinned above the listing (openBrowsePicker()) accepts any absolute
 * path, including a UNC share (`\\server\share`), on Enter/Go, and a
 * failed lookup (400) reports inline right under that input — via its own
 * `pathErrorEl`, never by blanking the whole dialog — leaving the picker
 * open so the user can just fix the path and retry; every OTHER navigation
 * (a folder row, the back row, the drive list) now reports through that
 * same inline slot for the same reason, unifying what used to be a
 * separate whole-dialog error view.
 *
 * Categories (FORMAT.md §7.2 amendment, owner ask 2026-07-19): typing a name
 * STARTING WITH `#` into the ＋ New row creates a CATEGORY instead of an
 * entry (POST `/notebook/category`; the `#`s + surrounding whitespace are
 * stripped from the stored name — see isCategoryNameInput()/
 * categoryNameFromInput()). Category headers, rendered from the §5
 * `categories` list rather than derived from `entries` (so an EMPTY
 * category still shows — see renderList()'s two-pointer merge of
 * `categories` and `entries`, both already in file order), are CLICKABLE:
 * selecting one (selectCategory()) enters "category mode" —
 * `state.activeCategory` holds its name, the header highlights, and the
 * SAME editor pane/textarea/Save button/dirty-tracking/base_mtime-conflict
 * machinery entry-editing already used now targets that category's §3.1
 * description (GET/POST `/notebook/category`) instead — see
 * performSaveCategory(), the category-mode sibling of performSave().
 * `state.modeHintEl` (a muted line directly above the textarea) always says
 * which of the two the editor currently targets. Category mode is
 * deliberately UI-only: it is never allowed to touch `state.selection`,
 * `state.activeName`, the `entry` widget, or multi-select — clicking an
 * entry always exits it (chooseSelection() clears `activeCategory`, and
 * reloads the entry pane even if the clicked entry was already the
 * "active" one underneath category mode) and clicking a header always
 * enters it, but neither path ever calls setSelection()/syncEntryWidget().
 * Delete is entry-only and disabled outright in category mode
 * (updateDeleteButtonEnabled()); double-clicking a header focuses the name
 * field exactly like double-clicking an entry row does (see "Rename via
 * the editor's name field" above) — it never opens anything header-local.
 *
 * Single-tap collapse (owner ask 2026-07-19 "single tap category name to
 * collapse category"): a plain tap on a header now does TWO things at once
 * — toggleCategoryCollapse() flips its membership in
 * `state.collapsedCategories` (a plain `Set<string>`, created once per
 * node in createState() and never read by anything outside this file) and
 * selectCategory() still enters category mode, exactly as before. Collapse
 * state is deliberately NOT a node property and never touches
 * `entry`/`file` — it lives only on this in-memory `Set`, so it is pure
 * per-node, per-session UI state: it survives any number of renderList()
 * redraws (renderList() reads the Set fresh every call and skips a
 * collapsed category's entry rows, still rendering the header itself) but
 * resets on a page reload, and — critically, given the file header's
 * opening promise that "only `file` + `entry` persist" — it is NEVER
 * serialized into the workflow. A collapsed category's entries are simply
 * absent from `state.dragRows` too, so they're inert (no click, no drag
 * source) until expanded again; the header itself stays a valid drop
 * TARGET either way (computeDropTarget()'s category-append geometry
 * degrades to "append after the header" when there's nothing visible
 * under it, the same fallback an actually-empty category already used).
 *
 * Drag a category header (owner ask 2026-07-19 "drag category and
 * everything in it"): a header is now ALSO a drag SOURCE, not just a drop
 * target — onCategoryPointerDown() is the header's sibling of
 * onEntryPointerDown() below, sharing the same pointerdown/move/up
 * threshold-disambiguation gesture (beginDrag/endDragVisuals/positionMarker
 * are kind-agnostic; updateDrag()/finishDrag() branch on `drag.kind`).
 * Below the threshold it resolves to the tap behavior above (toggle
 * collapse + selectCategory); at/past it, it commits to relocating the
 * WHOLE category block via `POST /notebook/move_category`
 * (performMoveCategory(), computeCategoryDropTarget() — valid targets are
 * only "before another category header" or "end of file", never "into"
 * anything, since §3.4 Move category has no such primitive).
 *
 * Multiselect drag into a category (owner ask 2026-07-19): dragging any
 * ENTRY that's part of a 2+ selection moves the whole `state.selection`,
 * in selection order, to wherever that one drag's pointer lands —
 * dragMoveNames() decides the moving set, computeDropTarget() excludes all
 * of them (not just the grabbed row) from the drop geometry, and
 * performMoveRun() (performDeleteRun()'s sibling) sends one
 * `/notebook/move` per name, refreshing `base_mtime` from each response so
 * the run can't self-conflict, re-using the SAME resolved target for every
 * entry — which is what keeps the moved block's relative order intact,
 * since inserting each subsequent name "before the same sibling" (or
 * "onto the same category's current end") naturally stacks them in
 * selection order. See performMoveRun()'s own doc for the geometry
 * argument in full. A single-entry drag is unaffected — it still resolves
 * to plain performMove().
 *
 * Vanilla ES modules, no build step — DOM nodes are built with
 * `document.createElement` (see the local `el()` helper) rather than any
 * templating, matching this pack's other frontend modules.
